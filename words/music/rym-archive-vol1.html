								favorites. My solution, one that I'm grateful I
								came up with to this day, was to start
								cataloguing, rating, and reviewing everything on
								RateYourMusic.com. It helped me learn how to
								write in my own voice and what I really liked
								about the art that moved me.

						</h2>
						<img

							alt=""
						/>
						<p>
							An average little indie pop rock album with some
							light psychedelic and bluesy influences prominent on
							some tracks. Interestingly enough, the songs that
							embraced these influences were not only the most
							distinctive on the album, but also my personal
							favorites, which led me to wonder about why they
							insisted on the fairly uninspired standard indie
							fair for the rest of the LP. Couple very annoying
							duds on here as well, "Shadow People" in particular,
							but on the whole, it's not bad. Just a tad boring.

						</h2>
						<img

							alt=""
						/>
						<p>
							Nearly any and all inconsistencies with
							<i>Flockaveli</i>
							are erased by how
							<b>fun</b>
							this album is. Pure adrenaline-pumping trap from
							start to finish. Suspension of disbelief is almost
							necessary to enjoy Waka's music, but when it clicks,
							it clicks hard. One of the best "car music" albums
							ever; every song is quotable and loud.
							Unfortunately, other Flocka albums aren't as
							consistent as this, but the fact that this one
							exists pretty validates his popularity and presence
							in the hip-hop industry by itself.

						</h2>
						<img
							class="album-cover"
							src="../../img/music/rym-archive-vol1/an-awesome-wave.jpg"
							alt=""
						/>
						<p>
							<i>An Awesome Wave</i>
							reads like a cookbook for the "smart pop album":
							instrumental or a capella interludes; quirky,
							atypical vocals; a combination of traits from two
							generally unrelated genres (in this case, folk and
							what I think is probably dubstep); and forced
							'quiet' sections where they show off average lyrics
							like some exposé. Toss in a cryptic band name and
							album cover and you've got a stew going.
						</p>
						<p>
							That said, it's not terrible, just inauthentic. It
							feels like the members of the band (who I'm sure are
							individually talented) are mostly preoccupied with
							appealing to Pitchfork staff. It's unfocused and a
							bit self-absorbed, and if it shed a little off of
							either of those, it could be a great foundation
							going forward for Alt-J. Tracks like "MS" and "Taro"
							show that these guys have the tools to be a pretty
							successful dream-pop outfit, but their recent
							releases seem to be pretty deadset on advancing
							whatever brilliant ideas they had that led to this
							failure.

						<p>
							Equal parts Earth, Wind & Fire and Rick Astley.
							Funky, great riffs, great vocals, and a ton of fun
							to listen to. It obviously feels dated, and with
							cheese comes both greatness and duds, but the groove
							present here is usually enough to overcome some of
							those issues. Never thought I'd thank vaporwave for
							anything, but looking for the sample on "Library" by
							<i>Macintosh Plus</i>
							took me on a journey across time square onto the set
							of a 1978 softcore porn set.

						</h2>
						<img
							class="album-cover"
							src="../../img/music/rym-archive-vol1/ying-yang.png"
							alt=""
						/>
						<p>
							This is pretty much Mac DeMarco's
							<i>Overly Dedicated</i>
							.
							<i>Ying Yang</i>
							is a decent release that shows a lot of what he'd
							build on in the future, but also a lot of what we
							should be glad he didn't. I will say this: the lo-fi
							production suits he and Calder very well, and fans
							of Mac will definitely enjoy a lot of this because
							of it. It's got lots of rookie mistakes and some
							lazy songwriting in places, but hey, it grooves, and
							that's what you're here for, right?

							Tyler, the Creator - Bastard (2009) - ★★½☆
						</h2>
						<img
							class="album-cover"
							src="../../img/music/rym-archive-vol1/bastard.png"
							alt=""
						/>
						<p>
							This is such a hot-and-cold record. On one hand, it
							obviously need to be lambasted for its immaturity.
							<i>Bastard</i>
							is littered with references to raping women, killing
							innocent people, and generally violent behavior,
							usually meant in jest and yet much more disturbing
							that it's coming from a 17-year-old. And on the
							other, it's amazing how much talent is present in
							this record when Tyler chose the right avenues.
						</p>
						<p>
							This LP has many flaws, and just about half of these
							songs are flat-out bad. But there's something about
							the naivety and youthfulness in these tracks that
							make the whole thing mostly entertaining. When Tyler
							is focused and not just saying edgy stuff for the
							sake of saying edgy stuff, there's actually good
							musicianship here. This is again juxtaposed by the
							laughably low-quality synths and percussion; the
							whole records pushes stock Frooty Loops effects to
							their limits. It's mixed like shit, and is pretty
							lo-fi in its production (which actually suits it
							quite well).
						</p>
						<p>
							I'm not sure why I enjoy this thing at all. It's
							corny, it's childish, it's stupid, but I can't think
							of a single thing like it. Tyler's clearly got a
							story to tell here - and the production talent to
							get it across - but immaturity and a desire to pad
							his project with ironic banger-types hold it back
							from something greater.

						</h2>

							alt=""
						/>
						<p>
							I really cannot say whether or not Ty Segall
							actually has it in him to be great - all I know is
							that I really am not enjoying these cobbled-together
							releases every year. It seems he just peruses bands
							from 1960-1975 and then writes a song in dedication,
							ad infinitum, and then sells the most recent 10
							every 6 months. Completely directionless, totally
							worthless solos and vocals, and only really gets fun
							when he turns the energy up, which is like 4/9 songs
							here. I think most should pass on this one.

						</h2>
						<img
							class="album-cover"
							src="../../img/music/rym-archive-vol1/godfather.jpg"
							alt=""
						/>
						<p>
							This is a bombastic collection of songs by Wiley at
							his most contemporary, for better and worse. The
							merging of grime and trap music seemed pretty
							inevitable, and there is some fair respect to both
							the origins of the UK hip-hop scene and the
							developments of drill in recent years there.
						</p>
						<p>
							What holds
							<i>Godfather</i>
							back from real acclaim is simply its length - there
							are 5 shockingly bad songs that hold this back from
							being among the better albums of the year. If he can
							drop the filler, Wiley may be headed towards a
							career revival... but it is likely that his best
							effort at one is
							<i>Godfather</i>
							itself.

						</h2>
						<img
							class="album-cover"
							src="../../img/music/rym-archive-vol1/i-see-you.png"
							alt=""
						/>
						<p>
							The progression of The xx from quaint alt-pop trio
							to garage-R&B outfit has become more apparent as
							Jamie xx has taken over the mainstream from 2012 to
							present. With Jamie dominating the club scene for
							all of 2015 and 2016, surely his solo influences
							would not hold back on newer work with the band that
							gave him his name.
						</p>
						<p>
							The xx's evolution is only half-successful here, but
							the highs show glimpses of a totally different
							identity we are accustomed to. Whether it's the
							Beatles sample on "Say Something Loving", the dance
							beat in "On Hold", or the blaring horns on the
							opening track "Dangerous", it seems there is some
							creative impulse left in the tank of what many
							thought would be a band with not much left to
							explore. How long Jamie will pursue his ventures
							into dance-pop with The xx - and how successful
							he'll be - is another question altogether, though.

							John Coltrane - Blue Train (1958) - ★★☆☆
						</h2>
						<img
							class="album-cover"
							src="../../img/music/rym-archive-vol1/blue-train.jpg"
							alt=""
						/>
						<p>
							I was once assigned this album to review back in 6th
							grade as a make-up for having to miss my band
							recital. I was able to pick any album from a list,
							as long as it featured my instrument, the tenor sax,
							front and center.
						</p>
						<p>
							I ended up picking Blue Train because it was my
							prick director's favorite album of all time, and
							because I needed some brownie points (the sax
							section was in deep shit at the time - I ditched
							practices often because I took my studies more
							seriously). As I was only learning classical pieces
							at the time, you could say this was my first
							meaningful exposure to jazz, ever. And at the time,
							I hated it.
						</p>
						<p>
							Today marks the first time I've revisited Blue Train
							since then. I'm much more familiar with Coltrane now
							than I was then, and although I don't play much sax
							nowadays I do have a strong appreciation for the
							instrument. However, having heard a number of
							Coltrane's more 'standard' hard bop affairs, this
							one falls quite flat in comparison.
						</p>
						<p>
							It peaks on the bombastic "Locomotion" in my book -
							Coltrane finally lets loose and the band is tight,
							paving the road for him to take over and dance a
							little. Unfortunately, this is just about the only
							piece where John isn't noticeably lackadaisical
							("I'm Old Fashioned" and the title track being
							particular for me). I'm all for restraint on the
							player's part on behalf of letting the ensemble's
							groove shine, but the pieces here are not
							particularly engaging even during the solos. A solid
							outing nonetheless, but not one of Coltrane's finest
							by any means.

							Lizzy Mercier Descloux - Press Color (1979) - ★½☆☆
						</h2>
						<img
							class="album-cover"
							src="../../img/music/rym-archive-vol1/press-color.jpg"
							alt=""
						/>
						<p>
							One of the more confusing records I've ever heard.
							The first two tracks promise a pleasant, if standard
							art punk experience with believably tight mixing.
							<i>Press Color</i>
							is obviously well-produced, with crisp drumming and
							the same droning electricity in the guitars often
							found in albums of the same style.
						</p>
						<p>
							Unfortunately, Descloux spends the remainder of the
							project... struggling. A majority of her vocal
							performance here is breathy scatting and the
							minimalist instrumentation gives her the spotlight -
							exacerbating even minor annoyances to unbearable
							degrees. "Jim on the Move" especially stands out for
							its brashness - 2 and a half minutes of breathy
							pants that goes absolutely nowhere. Would-be hits
							crumble to dust in seconds.
						</p>
						<p>
							While many may be able to trace and appreciate
							Descloux's origins in No Wave and her commitment to
							bringing that vocal style to a more structured
							style, as it stands, this is a failure. Another cult
							classic from the late 70s that I can't manage to
							understand.

						</h2>
						<img
							class="album-cover"
							src="../../img/music/rym-archive-vol1/fat-albert-rotunda.jpg"
							alt=""
						/>
						<p>
							A sort of misfit album in Herbie's discography,
							recorded as a soundtrack to a TV special after his
							elegant modal jazz success but before his second
							career as a sonic astronaut. While it has glimpses
							of a bombastic, New Orleans-influenced sound true to
							the source material, it never commits, comfortable
							in "merely" having a good time and playing loud.
							What's left is a good, if relatively nondescript
							outing in Hancock's career, though it is an
							interesting first step in his life after Blue Note.

						</h2>
						<img
							class="album-cover"
							src="../../img/music/rym-archive-vol1/maiden-voyage.jpg"
							alt=""
						/>
						<p>
							Aptly named,
							<i>Maiden Voyage</i>
							does exert an air of sophistication and adventure
							that can be reminiscent of a cruise-ship ballroom.
							While nothing here dips below "pleasant", its
							complacency in its coolness can sometimes make
							active listening feel unrewarding - especially
							towards the middle of the session. Despite this, the
							title track remains an all-time highlight (and
							culturally significant jazz standard) to this day. I
							only wish I could say the same for the others.

							J Dilla - Donuts (2006) - ★★★☆
						</h2>
						<img
							class="album-cover"
							src="../../img/music/rym-archive-vol1/donuts.jpg"
							alt=""
						/>
						<p>
							It may be 2017, but I've actually been listening to
							this album near-religiously for close to 5 years.
							I've always considered
							<i>Donuts</i>
							to be the perfect counterexample to the rating
							system that I've been building on for however many
							years now. Perhaps it's even missing the point a bit
							to dissect it into pieces like this. Oh well.
						</p>
						<p>
							I generally try to divorce the musical content of a
							release from the context of its development, to
							avoid getting caught up in a narrative that may
							influence my opinions of the music itself. However,
							I find it to be an exercise in frustration trying to
							remove the context of the producer's own death from
							an album that nails such a vibrant and hopeful tone.
							Dilla put this together to help his loved ones cope
							with his own passing, bidding them farewell and
							telling them to remember the bright moments of life.
							It is simply not worth my time to pretend that this
							additional emotional impact isn't present.
						</p>
						<p>
							On the musical side of things, my problem with the
							vast majority of instrumental hip-hop tapes -
							Dilla's earlier work
							<i>definitely</i>
							not withstanding - is a personal, subjective
							inability to determine what the point of its
							inception was. Most are just a compilation of
							assorted instrumentals that were definitely made to
							be rapped over and not for individual commercial
							release, and that always felt like a hollow
							investment to me.
							<i>Donuts</i>
							is not completely free of these issues, but it does
							make massive strides towards fixing them, mostly by
							way of simply giving a shit.
						</p>
						<p>
							The transitions are smooth. The samples chosen are
							deliberate and are, very critically, given the
							chance to shine by themselves. There are no 45-60
							second lulls in the tracks where it's obvious a
							verse should have been; in fact many tracks hardly
							extend past that length in their entirety. There is
							an emphasis on incorporating subtler breaks with
							soul, funk, and gospel sampling creates a cohesive
							bounce. Perhaps most creatively, some of the vocals
							here are chopped to serve as a surrogate voice for
							Dilla himself - "Don't Cry" being an especially
							poignant example. It is inspiring to me just how
							much it's apparent J used
							<i>Donuts</i>
							as an emotional outlet on his deathbed.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, with a total roster of 31 tracks (the
							majority of which are simply 1-2 minute ideas that
							are gone before you can think too hard), it
							seriously would not have hurt to remove some jarring
							inclusions, especially "Thunder", "Walkinonit", "The
							Twister", and "Da Factory". The more frustrating
							part is they aren't even poorly-composed or
							uninteresting, just unfinished pieces that are
							difficult to enjoy by themselves without thinking of
							what could have been.
						</p>
						<p>
							Still,
							<i>Donuts</i>
							is soulful, emotional, groovy, and escapes regular
							genre trappings by being rewarding in both casual
							and critical listenings, and it safely earns the
							merit of its reputation.

						<p>
							While I very much dislike the plump, bouncy

							the works of Grant Kirkhope), I can understand that
							most of that is due to what sounded and worked best

							alt=""

						<p>
							This eccentric early 70s breakout album from Velvet
							Underground contributor John Cale is a little more
							legend than it is reality. Cale's songwriting is
							tight and the Welsh folk influence gives the entire

						<p>
							An earnest collection of 1928 recordings from the
							Okeh Electric days of Delta blues folk hero
							Mississippi John Hurt. It's a concise and
							atmospheric compilation that has a beautiful DIY
							charm that just drips from the modest southern twang
							in Hurt's voice. Ture to his roots in the

							Chris Lucey - Songs of Protest & Anti-Protest (1965)
							- ★★★☆
						</h2>
						<img
							class="album-cover"
							src="../../img/music/rym-archive-vol1/chris-lucey.jpg"
							alt=""
						/>
						<p>
							Chris Lucey is the original nom de plume of Bobby
							Jameson, a name recently thrust back into the
							spotlight because of Ariel Pink's new project named
							in honor of his passing. Jameson was a troubled
							artist that left the music industry depressed and
							addicted after being financially stiffed by his
							record label overlords for years, even with his
							largest successes.
						</p>
						<p>
							This album was basically a repossession project by
							Surrey Records, who needed to quickly replace 10
							songs by a Chris Ducey after finding he was under
							contract with another label. They got some random
							20-year-old willing to write and record an album
							under the name Chris Lucey, and write songs named
							the same as Ducey's original setlist, to minimize
							rebranding costs for an already broke record label.
							What young Bobby was able to assemble with a
							nonexistent budget and a time crunch is incredibly
							impressive.
						</p>
						<p>
							While coming in only a little over 26 minutes from
							front to back, the songs here are rich with healthy
							influences of the time. You can hear Arthur Lee and
							Stan Getz in equal proportion, and some of the
							arrangements, especially on the opening track and

						<p>
							Much less immediate than its predecessors, King
							Krule's
							<i>The OOZ</i>
							is a hazy, abstract project soaked in the familiar
							melancholy of his previous work. There is a
							noticeably larger focus towards mood and atmosphere,
							and the influences spread far and wide. There are
							flecks of jazz (think
							<i>In a Silent Way</i>
							), ambient, early-80s art punk, and a sparse,
							depressive production style reminiscent of Arthur
							Russell, and despite it all, it never feels even
							slightly divorced of the 2010s indie paradigm.
						</p>
						<p>
							But make no mistake, this is assuredly not the same
							Archy Marshall that arrived on the scene in 2012.
							While the foundation of a crooning, sombre youth
							persists throughout, this is much more
							contemplative, more hesitant, and perhaps even a bit
							fleeting because of it. It is grey clouds, hot tea,
							warm sweater, cold rain, white-noise-on-the-TV
							music; for better or worse, those days are calming,
							but immobile and consequently indiscernible from one
							another.
						</p>
						<p>
							Someone much more out of their self could argue that
							those such days hardly feel like days at all, almost
							more of a mood, untethered to time... and perhaps
							that's the best way I could describe
							<i>The OOZ</i>
							, as well.

							Another moody, evocative effort from tape loop

							, which has great ambient pieces in its own right.
							While it can meander a bit toward the center, a

						<p>
							I don't really understand birds all that well, but I
							like them. They're dichotomous in that for what are
							usually colorful, singing flutterers, they hide a
							rather angular brain. Their heads flicker around
							like androids receiving movement instructions, and
							they are rather vicious - even the pretty ones. In

							beings that appreciate and live through song. I
							suppose Bjork feels similarly, and I'm glad someone
							as capable as her followed through on such a curious
							inspiration.
						</p>
						<p>
							I am becoming increasingly worried by the fact that
							I compare all music to video games, but
							<i>Utopia</i>
							evokes similar imagery to that of the Sky Temple in
							<i>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</i>
							. For the unfamiliar, it's a massive, organic, and
							slightly dilapidated aviary in the sky populated by
							goofy and intelligent alien-bird-people. As peaceful
							as it sounds, there is something... unsettling to
							it. An angularity. The creatures walk on the walls
							and ceilings when unattended. The music, despite its
							classical instrumentation, is fairly twitchy and
							indeterminate. I'm not sure what Arca has been up to
							lately, but I wouldn't be surprised if some Zelda
							was in there somewhere.
						</p>
						<p>
							Despite the dysto-classical fantasy imagery, mostly
							indebted to some stellar flute work by a 12-piece
							section curated by Bjork herself, there is a pace
							here - a clear energy driven by Arca's unbelievable
							deconstruction of this avian garden idealism. It all
							at once sounds like something from the distant past
							and future, and Bjork sends it into overdrive with
							some of her best vocal performances in years, and
							particularly topical lyrics about modern, temporary
							love. It's a "Tinder album", as she once described,
							but I can't help but feel this would have been just
							as pertinent in 1917 and 2117.

						<p>
							Hazy, lo-fi, low-tempo, synthy dream-pop that could

							I kind of in awe that Migos had this much material

							I must agree with the consensus reception to
							<i>Culture II</i>
							that its length is very much to its detriment. This

							hooks, top-40 pandering, low-effort features, and
							re-treads of similar ideas from its predecessor.

						<p>
							But there is worthwhile content here to be had,

						<p>
							The comparisons JPEGMAFIA usually gets are endless,
							so I'll abridge it by saying this is very much an
							alt-experimental 2010s rap project. Even still,
							<i>Veteran</i>
							finds unique footing in his percussive presence and
							(slightly more traditional,) cocksure lyrical
							delivery. Every single track here, without

							off-beats, triplets, and syncopation.
						</p>
						<p>
							And good lord, this man has some great production
							libraries assembled. Dozens of samples of video

						<p>
							<i>Romantic Warrior</i>
							is my favorite album to read reviews of - it just
							gets people in a frenzy regardless of what they
							think of it. Some believe it to be emblematic of the
							masturbatory urges of white jazz fusion (Di Meola is
							the only white man on the roster, so...), while
							others find it to be a silly and outrageously
							technical triumph for the group. This album has been
							discussed for over four decades, so I'm really
							whispering in a courtroom at this point, but I think
							it's perfectly fine to think both prevailing sides
							have some leverage here.
						</p>
						<p>
							The actual playing on this thing is outstanding. The
							band is tight as all hell, with Corea and Di Meola
							stealing the show per usual with blazing melodies
							and solos over sporadic, occasionally goofy time and
							key changes. "Duel of the Jester and the Tyrant" has
							a build-up of something close to 6 minutes of pure
							Corea/Di Meola pressure, and then the band stops to
							play at kitschy little sketch that sounds an awful
							lot like "Koopa Cape" from
							<i>Mario Kart Wii</i>
							. You gotta love it.
						</p>
						<p>
							The arrangements here are weird, straight up, with
							Corea writing half and the other 3 writing one a
							piece - usually trying to include some kind of
							comedic element or overly-dramatic motif. The album
							shares a very light medieval theme (as evidenced by
							the artwork and song titles - I can't tell if any
							musical medieval influence was taken here), but
							assumes the tone of something closer to
							<i>Princess Bride</i>
							than
							<i>Excalibur</i>
							. I don't really know how to describe it, but it can
							definitely occasionally feel like the entire band
							was playing just to fuck with you. For some more
							sensitive or picky listeners (and honestly that
							comprises just about all fusion fans), this could be
							seen as affronting.
						</p>
						<p>
							But if you have a sense of humor, can appreciate
							sheer technical showboating, and have a penchant for
							racing game soundtracks from the turn of the
							millenium, you will walk away from
							<i>Romantic Warrior</i>
							with your jaw on the floor and a confused smile. For
							everyone else, well, take a crack at it, at least.

						<p>
							Esthero's voice is completely beautiful and clear,
							and a lot of the songs are exceptionally
							well-written (tracks 3-5 really stand out in that
							regard) and McKinney makes pretty consistent choices
							in production for her outside of the two terrible

							track or by a track's over-reliance on (what were

							<i>Breath From Another</i>
							is genuinely good late-90s pop album, with strong

							This is probably the largest fall from grace a

							style of cokehouse R&B is just less fashionable than
							it used to be.
						</p>
						<p>
							While the aforementioned tracks are still very
							listenable, I was taken aback how poorly the rest of
							the album has aged, even compared to albums that
							influenced Tesfaye (
							<i>Man on the Moon</i>
							,
							<i>So Far Gone</i>
							) or from the same scene a couple years later (

						<p>
							I can see why this is interesting to the outside

						<p>
							An impossibly endearing pop-rap album, to the point

							<i>Man on the Moon</i>
							came out when I was in middle school and it
							completely torched the iTunes charts, especially for

							argument this album introduced an entire generation
							(read: 2-3 year gap of kids born in 94-96) to weed,

							crooning over psychedelic beats by Plain Pat, and
							with his collaborations with other favorites of the
							time in MGMT and Ratatat and mysterious
							apprenticeship with local legend Kanye West, the guy
							was an overnight sensation.
						</p>
						<p>
							The other half of Cudi's appeal was of course his
							lyrical content, which is very honest about his
							personal troubles with addiction, confidence, and
							depression. The "story arc" of the project gives it
							a definitive flow between its manic and depressive
							tracks, tied together by a narrator in Common (who
							makes an appearance here rapping on "Make Her Say").
							His lyrical honesty and melodic flow shows an absurd
							ceiling of musical potential on the clear highlight
							"Hyyerr", where he rips a beautiful and rhythmic
							beat while telling a story of how he fell into
							addiction and eventually got out of it, turning into
							an anxious smoker.

							This could be the corniest thing you've ever heard,
							and if you like your music dark and serious there's

						</p>
						<p style="color: #aaa">
							<i>
								"The whole tape extends from one of my closest
								friends Oliver. One night we were having a
								discussion about women and the way we were
								talking about them, it was so brazen and so
								disrespectful. He texted me right after we got
								off the phone and he was like, 'Are we becoming
								the men that our mothers divorced?'
							</i>
						</p>
						<p style="color: #aaa">
							<i>
								...The title has a lot of meanings—as the way we
								carry ourselves, the way we dress, the way
								people view us, not to sound cocky, it's just
								that feeling that we're just distanced in a good
								way. You’re just elevating past the bullshit and
								past all the shit that you used to be a part of
								and you're not that proud of, you're just so far
								gone."
							</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							If that doesn't explain how differently Drake was
							thinking about rap music, even as a 23-year-old with
							one mixtape out, then the actual music here
							certainly will.
						</p>
						<p>
							For a mixtape, this is an overwhelming success in
							making a cohesive atmosphere out of indie pop, R&B,
							and (at the time) uncharted territory of moody,
							ambient drama-rap. There are precisely zero rappers
							active in 2018 that would dare to make a song based
							around a freaking Peter Bjorn and John sample, and
							fewer still that would do a straight up love song
							duet like "Little Bit." Drake was, at the very
							least, bold, even if his boldness was manifested in
							decisively un-cool ideas relative to his peers. It
							really is thanks to him, Cudi, and Kanye that
							artists in the 2010s were able to have their guards
							up a little less in the hip-hop world, and the big
							cultural tipping point was
							<i>So Far Gone</i>
							.
						</p>
						<p>
							The cruel irony of it all is that the major drags on
							this album tend to be when he forgets how potent he
							is as a trailblazing act and defaults back to really
							tired punchline rap. Tons of (appropriate) homage is
							played to classic and contemporary R&B and pop acts,
							but taking a track to dedicate to Houston's DJ
							Screw, complete with adoption of H-Town lingo and
							flows on the instrumental from Screw's absolutely
							legendary "June 27" sessions doesn't feel right for
							a guy who's really more of a pop star in the other
							15 tracks. It's fun, but it doesn't sit right. What
							does feel good is how much fun it sounds like he's
							having, whether it's ripping apart the "Ignorant
							Shit" beat with Wayne or busting out the falsetto
							with Omarion on "Bria's Interlude." It's kind of
							infectious, if we're being honest.

							While Drake does a lot of trend-catching these days,
							usually with passable results, it's refreshing to
							hear how hungry he was in his major coming out party
							despite having a style completely unique to his own.
							The guy was a true hybrid act, and his production
							team (including a young 40, D10
							<i>and</i>
							Boi-1da) managed to find an ambient and moody lane
							that let Drake embellish his influences, whether
							they're from Alicia Keys, UGK, or Tank - no matter
							what he was doing, it was a brand new context for
							how to succeed with those styles. It is not perfect,
							but for me personally, it remains one of the best
							pop projects of 2009.

							Q-Tip - The Renaissance (2007) - ★★★☆
						</h2>

						<p>
							The warmer weather and a recent binge through A
							Tribe Called Quest's discography has me totally
							invested in
							<i>The Renaissance</i>
							. For a first-time solo effort, this feels
							completely effortless - it's a completely logical
							and natural progression from the fluffy,
							Dilla-driven final efforts of ATCQ, with slightly
							poignant and mature themes and more sophisticated
							instrumentation.
						</p>
						<p>
							The funk is in the air for all 47 minutes, with
							tasteful bass riffs, little synth flurries, and
							hypnotic percussion from front to back. It really
							feels like Q-Tip took the recent work of Erykah Badu
							and D'Angelo (who is featured here, and kills it) to
							heart as natural extensions of what he helped
							establish, and it's cool to see him manifest what he
							really always had in him.

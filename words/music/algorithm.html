						<p>
							Surprising nobody who lived in a world without them,
							the advent of music streaming services has
							dramatically changed music consumption habits. Most
							of the changes center the convenience of the
							consumer - less time fiddling with .mp3s, on-demand
							service, and a lower overall cost. The downsides to
							streaming services are innumerable, and will not be
							the focus here, but one in particular bothers me:
							how the act of searching for music has become
							trivial. Smart recommendation algorithms can and
							will just match you with exactly what you want to
							hear, or what you think you want to hear.
						</p>
						<p>
							This has some unintended consequences that would
							make Foucault blush. Many people listen to songs
							brought to them by the holy algorithm, and it’s so
							perfectly aligned to their tastes that it glides
							right past them. They don’t even know who it’s by,
							or care to know. Headphones on, playlist begins,
							don’t worry about it. Names of artists, songs, even
							genres completely evade listeners because they
							aren’t useful information to find similar music
							anymore. The act of listening itself is the search,
							every song a data point to further narrow the
							parameters of “you.”
						</p>
						<p>
							Real heads will tell you another critical flaw of
							streaming services: what feels like an endless well
							of music is really not that deep. While a
							significant portion of the popular acts of
							yesteryear have a presence, many artists of the past
							and overseas don’t find the idea of hosting their
							music on streaming services all that compelling. Who
							can blame them when the financial incentive is
							pitiful? Strangely enough, the new home for many of
							these musical obscurities is YouTube, a space
							untethered by any real expectations of format or
							locality. People post albums they find interesting,
							and sooner or later people find them and listen.

						<p>
							But YouTube is not a perfectly egalitarian archive -
							no, it too has algorithms to continue servicing
							content they think you’ll enjoy, so you spend more
							time there and fatten the pockets of digital
							marketers everywhere. YouTube’s algorithm isn’t just
							bizarre, it’s unwieldy. It acts on a whim, promotes
							tiny DIY videos from the aughts to overnight viral
							hits, crashes careers of professional YouTubers for
							not perfectly obeying every hidden content feature
							required for an automatic marketing push. In a word,
							the YouTube recommendation algorithm is fucked. It
							makes no sense, and abides by no humanly
							comprehensible rules.
						</p>
						<p>
							One odd, beautiful consequence of this is the
							unlikely propulsion of obscure artists of the past
							into modern stardom. Look no further than
							<a
								href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bNITQR4Uso"
							>
								Mariya Takeuchi’s “Plastic Love,”
							</a>
							a beautiful, stylish 1984 pop ballad from Japan that
							is, inexplicably, instantly recognizable by a
							sizable chunk of online youths. When music is the
							content being curated, the infinitely complicated,
							ever-hungry algorithm-beast plays the unlikely role
							of hitmaker, an eclectic DJ with a bottomless well
							of eclectic analog magic to dig up for any ears
							willing to listen.
						</p>
						<p>
							What I’d like to shine a light on are four cult
							classic albums, each with their fans but given a
							brand new lease on life thanks to the whims of the
							algorithm. The artists in questions passed away
							before their work reached the audience it was never
							fated to have, four Van Goghs who would never
							understand the respect and admiration they would
							hold in the years following their deaths. They are,
							against all odds, the folk heroes of the algorithm.

						<h2 id="album-subtitle">Ryo Fukui - Scenery (1976)</h2>
						<img
							class="album-cover-big"
							src="../../img/music/algorithm/scenery.jpg"
							alt=""
						/>
						<p>
							Ryo Fukui is the ultimate underdog, the people’s
							champion, jazz’s worst kept secret. For many, his
							story is possibly more compelling than the music he
							created - a jazz fan with a limited musical
							background, he started teaching himself piano at age
							22. Six years later, at the age of 28, he released
							his debut album,
							<i>Scenery</i>
							- a testament to his hard work and passion.
						</p>
						<p>
							I actually have a history with this project
							predating the algorithmic explosion. Among certain
							corners of the internet, it has for some time now
							been the jazz record from Japan. I still think this
							assertion is wildly reductive (for one, because it
							ignores the country’s fascinating and robust fusion
							period), and for a long time I let that stigma of
							association with Western collectors affect my
							opinion of it. Over the years, however, it’s beaten
							me down, and I can no longer deny its appeal.
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>Scenery</i>
							's best quality is the wonderful curation of the
							standards being played. There is a thematic feel to
							the record, with natural ebbs and flows in tone and
							energy that help showcase Ryo and his cohorts in a
							variety of styles. For 1976, it’s fairly old school
							- calling back to the hard bop days of decades prior
							and eschewing the more modern work being done in the
							world of fusion. It isn’t too upright, though - the
							bombastic “Early Summer” sounds like a holy
							invocation of the late, great McCoy Tyner, and the
							moody rendition of “I Want to Talk About You”
							calling the more nocturnal work of Bill Evans and
							Vince Guaraldi to mind.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is not to say that Fukui himself is a virtuosic
							player, though;
							<i>Scenery</i>
							is an album made better by its imperfections. The
							band is far from the sharpest you’ll hear, and they
							don’t bring anything particularly bold to the table,
							but the passion comes through instantly - even
							through some messier playing they are upbeat and
							persistent. When those moments do finally come, they
							feel triumphant and earned.
							<i>Scenery</i>
							doesn’t even sound like it’s being performed for a
							traditional audience, moreso for the titans of the
							genre, to earn that seat at the table. The cherry on
							top is the titular finale, “Scenery,” the only
							original composition. It’s a stoic, bluesy piece
							that confirms the seriousness of this whole
							endeavor.
						</p>
						<p>
							Ryo is the only artist featured here to possibly
							understand some amount of his modern popularity. A
							video of the full album, posted by user “Woody
							Allen” (fucker) was posted in December of 2015 and
							quickly garnered an audience of millions, likely
							helped by the relatively novel concept of overseas
							jazz and that wonderful album cover. Ryo died of
							lymphoma in just three months later in his home in
							Sapporo, Hokkaido.

							Emily Remler - Firefly (1981)
						</h2>
						<img
							class="album-cover-big"
							src="../../img/music/algorithm/firefly.jpg"
							alt=""
						/>
						<p>
							Emily Remler was the prodigy Fukui could never have
							been. A Jewish woman from New Jersey, she first
							picked up a guitar at only 10 years old, and spent
							her adolescence glued to her instrument of choice,
							eventually attending Berklee to study jazz guitar.
							At the age of 21, Herb Ellis was calling her a
							superstar. After three years playing in blues clubs
							in New Orleans, she released
							<i>Firefly</i>
							, her first recorded work.
						</p>
						<p>
							Like Fukui, Remler was an old soul. Her inspiration
							resided in the original titans of jazz guitar: swing
							legend and fellow prodigy Charlie Christian,
							collaborator extraordinaire Joe Pass, and especially
							the bluesy, hard bop stylings of Wes Montgomery. The
							result is that
							<i>Firefly</i>
							is a record played neatly and poised, with a quiet
							confidence that echoed far, far beyond her 24 years
							of age.
						</p>
						<p>
							The opening moments of the album’s opener, a
							gorgeous interpretation of Horace Silver’s
							“Strollin’,” basks the room in a glow. Its sunny,
							colorful bounce captures a particular serenity in
							Remler’s playing that shines across the entire
							40-minute runtime, like she knows precisely where to
							take any song at any moment, like she was born to
							put on a perfectly organized show. Remler was a
							gifted frontwoman, and she feels right at home with
							the bright curation of tunes.
						</p>
						<p>
							Obvious talent aside,
							<i>Firefly</i>
							can occasionally feel like the debut project it is.
							Remler’s love for the old-school seems to clash with
							her ability to start soaring, and she can play a few
							tunes, namely her own goofy “Perk’s Blues” and McCoy
							Tyner’s “Inception,” a bit too straight-laced.
							<i>Firefly</i>
							can also feel like a stepping stone towards
							something more introspective and contemporary. The
							gentle, drop-dead gorgeous “A Taste of Honey” and
							her rock-tinged glide through Wes Montgomery’s
							“Movin’ Along” seem to mirror the ECM style that
							guitarists of the era (Rypdal, Metheny, Abercrombie)
							commandeered, despite her fascination with the
							classics. Perhaps she could’ve incidentally
							furthered that emerging sound had she been given
							more time.
						</p>
						<p>
							Despite acclaim for her talents among critics and
							peers, her legacy was marred by poor longevity.
							Remler had demons, and she medicated with hard drugs
							that would contribute to her heart failure in 1990,
							at only 32 years old. Her passing was preceded by
							the recording of only her 7th project,
							<i>This Is Me</i>
							- a woefully short catalogue in comparison to her
							peers. Like many pioneering artists whose legacy
							will live forever, Remler’s also faded, momentarily.
							While the original viral YouTube upload of
							<i>Firefly</i>
							has since been taken down, it too reached an
							extraordinary pocket of internet listeners,
							recentering the spotlight on a forgotten prodigy.
						</p>
						<h2 id="album-subtitle">Gábor Szabó - Dreams (1968)</h2>
						<img
							class="album-cover-big"
							src="../../img/music/algorithm/dreams.jpg"
							alt=""
						/>
						<p>
							I’m cheating a little bit here: Hungarian guitarist
							Gábor Szabó has definitely seen his fair share of
							success, and well before YouTube had multiple claims
							to fame. He’s the original songwriter for “G****
							Queen,” made famous as one-half of Carlos Santana’s
							“Black Magic Woman.” He’s recorded with legendary
							jazzists like Tony Williams, Ron Carter, Bobby
							Womack and Mingus affiliates Chico Hamilton and
							Charles Lloyd. Though a C-lister himself, perhaps
							Szabó’s work did not need or warrant reappraisal.
						</p>
						<p>
							A hazy release right in the middle of Szabó’s
							career,
							<i>Dreams</i>
							is unsurprisingly otherworldly, but it also escapes
							any simple description. It can appear both
							incredibly, meticulously assembled, with tight
							orchestral arrangements reminiscent of third-stream,
							and the next moment rid itself of all structure,
							channeling a folksy, Manouche freedom. Szabó’s smoky
							guitarwork is somber and theatric, as though it once
							accompanied a storyteller’s tale through a long
							night at the campfire.
						</p>
						<p>
							Every track on
							<i>Dreams</i>
							builds toward an incorporeal setting, one of dancers
							and psychics. There is something deeply sad about
							the sound it aims to create - whether that’s a
							rhythm guitar stirring up tension in “The Fortune
							Teller” or a dissociative three-guitar quilt in
							“Song of Injured Love” that feels like a heavy joy,
							one fighting through pain. Even the bouncy intro
							“Galatea’s Guitar” sounds glum despite its groove
							and funk. One can only assume Szabó’s dreams kept
							him awake at night, if this is what they sounded
							like.
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>Dreams</i>
							is also occasionally a striking vision of the
							future. Its loose, folksy sound would be iterated on
							by the aforementioned Carlos Santana on his 1972
							project Caravanserai, despite its overt jazz-fusion
							nucleus. “Half the Day Is the Night” and the
							climactic closer “Ferris Wheel” incorporate baroque
							string sections for melancholic, looping harmonies
							that would not sound out of place in the
							post-rock-laced indie scene of the mid 2000s,
							notably Arcade Fire and The Antlers, despite
							preceding them by nearly 40 years.
						</p>
						<p>
							Surrounded by family in Budapest, Szabó passed away
							in 1982 of liver and kidney failure. He never lived
							to see the World Wide Web or the first commercial
							release of CDs, let alone watch a video of his own
							music play on a website. Still, his music inspired
							psychedelic curator Cubensis Records (to my
							knowledge, not an actual label) to share the
							entirety of
							<i>Dreams</i>
							in late 2015, nearly 33 years after his death,
							garnering millions of listens.
						</p>
						<h2 id="album-subtitle">
							Mort Garson - Plantasia (1976)
						</h2>
						<img
							class="album-cover-big"
							src="../../img/music/algorithm/plantasia.webp"
							alt=""
						/>
						<p>
							A small-time 1960s songwriter and composer, Mort
							Garson was an unassuming protagonist. He was
							well-received in smaller electronic circles for his
							instrumental work, even recording with Elektra and
							A&M, but never found widespread success.
							<i>Plantasia</i>
							, his last project before retirement, was an LP
							first conceived to be bundled with plants bought
							from Los Angeles horticultural outlet Mother Earth
							and played to spur their growth. It was an
							impossibly pure send-off.
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>Plantasia</i>
							is unique in that it sounds influential even when it
							wasn’t, sparking comparisons to a number of 1990s
							video game soundtracks (notably
							<i>Earthbound</i>
							and some DOS titles such as
							<i>Sam & Max</i>
							) and of course, Stevie Wonder’s similarly-inspired
							soundtrack for
							<i>The Secret Life of Plants</i>
							, which would be released only 3 years later. It
							even predates so-called tribal ambient, sparked by
							Jon Hassell’s
							<i>Vernal Equinox</i>
							, by 2 years. With the success of similar projects
							shortly after its release, it can be surprising that
							<i>Plantasia</i>
							languished in obscurity for most of its life; in
							retrospect, it seems it could have been a tipping
							point for electronic music as a whole, something
							that perfectly predicted where it was heading.
						</p>
						<p>
							The album is very much a ‘progressive electronic’
							record (a la the Berlin School), recorded in its
							entirety with a first-wave MOOG synthesizer. The
							“progressive” half of that label can be felt
							immediately in tracks like “Symphony for a Spider
							Plant” and “Concerto For Philodendron & Pothos,”
							with their concurrent synth leads weaving in and out
							to create a fantastical, psychedelic arrangement. In
							another timeline, perhaps “A Mellow Mood For
							Maidenhair” is a space-rock opera instead of an
							brooding, alien synth jam.
						</p>
						<p>
							It’s a decidedly optimistic space-age project, and
							while it’s not free of the lighthearted kitsch
							commonly associated with the era, it works in its
							favor. “Baby’s Tears Blues” is sly, sultry noir
							music to skulk through an alley to; “You Don’t Have
							to Walk a Begonia” embodies a juvenile, circus-like
							jest. In concept and execution,
							<i>Plantasia</i>
							captures the wonderment of the pre-digital era,
							content to spark feelings of joy, excitement, and
							love for their own sake.
						</p>
						<p>
							Mort Garson passed away of renal failure in 2008,
							well before
							<i>Plantasia</i>
							had a renewed lease on life. While he wouldn’t live
							to see the legions of adoring listeners for his work
							released over 30 years prior, he has been
							posthumously recognized as a visionary, one that was
							able to capture the mysterious and the provocative.
							The meteoric rise in popularity of
							<i>Plantasia</i>
							might be the algorithm’s finest moment, and one of
							the more joyful moments in internet history.
						</p>
						<p id="line">
							I am not a believer that music distribution and
							exploration is in a good place. It’s automated to
							the point of frictionlessness, and hardly engages
							the average listener. Without a system to really
							describe the qualities that you desire in music, or
							widespread vocabulary necessary or sufficient to
							make those qualities enumerable, the best the robots
							can do is guess. When major streaming platforms are
							financially incentivized to serve you music from the
							biggest labels, or to swerve you off of a path of
							deeper, niche discovery, everyone is kept in a tidy,
							if large musical bubble.
						</p>
						<p>
							Still, I cannot deny the mysticism of a
							recommendation algorithm forming a new digital
							canon, possibly because YouTube is not specifically
							designed to deliver music but has to anyway. Human
							perusal through the music of yesteryear is highly
							predicated on critical consensus, marketing, and
							enduring celebrity. Despite its immalleability, an
							automated approach untethered to human concepts of
							success or popularity at least has something new to
							say about which artists deserved to survive the
							fade, to form an lasting legacy. It has no clear
							methodology, but it can be viewed as a form of
							historical correction.
						</p>

							<figcaption>
								this isn't even on the weirder end of viral
								YouTube recommendations.
							</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							It also invites the listener to imagine an alternate
							history where these works did receive large-scale
							success in their day, perhaps inspiring others to
							follow suit and kicking off a different timeline of
							musical evolution. It’s also a quaint, if pointless
							exercise to imagine what YouTube’s algorithm sees in
							the music it propels to fame, if it too hears the
							talent and promise of these artists or just
							arbitrarily delivers based on unknowable criteria
							embedded in the upload itself.
						</p>
						<p>
							There is something certain about this situation,
							though: that it will continue indefinitely.
							Recommendation algorithms are very fancy
							profit-maximizing content delivery systems and there
							is no doubt in my mind that this practice will
							persist forever until something with even greater
							financial incentive comes along to replace it. These
							four artists may be some of the first to experience
							algorithmic success, but they will not be the last.
							I just hope that some of the folks who get selected
							by the machine in the future can live to see it.

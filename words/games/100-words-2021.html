						<h2 id="subtitle">Hyper Light Drifter (2016) - ★★★☆</h2>
						<p id="subtitle">
							<i>dev. Heart Machine, dir. Alx Preston</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							Heart Machine’s debut makes a meaningful discovery:
							that imagery alone can partially substitute
							conventional storytelling.
						</p>
						<p>
							What is discarded in detail is kept afloat by
							evocative symbolism and context clues, leaving a
							mostly intact narrative experience unshackled by the
							burdens of shallow, explanatory lore. The only real
							consequence is a snappier pace that complements its
							zippy combat, an evolution of Zelda DNA with
							twin-stick shooter elements, a trendy dash button,
							and highly curated, DOOM-esque combat rooms.
						</p>
						<p>
							In lieu of instructions, the player pays closer
							attention to the spaces before them, organically
							digesting every secret, every battle, every wordless
							scene of spectacle.

						<p id="subtitle">
							<i>dev. SEGA, dir. Shuntaro Tanaka</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							SEGA’s hammy, pseudo-WW2 tactics romp is about the
							draft and its consequences, of ill-suited soldiers
							dreaming of their old lives. Your squadron is filled
							with imperfect people, their allergies, phobias,
							orientations, and prejudices producing strengths and
							weaknesses in their new roles.
						</p>
						<p>
							On the battlefield these myriad perspectives are
							visited personally, the player forced to inhabit
							every body and fire every shot themselves, the
							controlled character’s traits manifesting as
							statistical impacts that inform (and even disturb!)
							your decision-making process.
						</p>
						<p>
							It inspires empathy, but unfortunately misses the
							logical conclusion of that inspiration: a similarly
							flawed and human army on the other side.

							Kirby Super Star Ultra (2008) - ★★½☆
						</h2>
						<p id="subtitle">
							<i>dev. HAL Laboratory, dir. Shinya Kumazaki</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							Some developers of
							<i>Super Star Ultra</i>
							were disappointed with the game’s final title. They
							felt they’d done enough work and added enough
							content to completely separate their work from the
							original
							<i>Super Star</i>
							for SNES.
						</p>
						<p>
							Unfortunately, all this amounts to legendary hubris
							-
							<i>Ultra</i>
							is a tit-for-tat remake, not only reworking the same
							Kirby spritework and copy mechanics in circulation
							since 2002 to match the source material, but totally
							and faithfully replicating
							<i>Super Star</i>
							’s concept and structure.
						</p>
						<p>
							The new content here simply tweaks the classic game
							modes, extending the runtime but certainly not
							transforming the experience. A fitting title after
							all.

							resemblance. 2016's
							<i>DOOM</i>
							suffers from this, manifesting as a glossy,
							<i>Halo</i>
							’d-up take on its namesake with fanservice garnish,
							but still manages to successfully modernize an older
							paradigm of shooter combat by recreating the pace,
							intensity and micromanagement.
						</p>
						<p>
							Each enemy type disrupts the player’s movement
							differently, and ammunition is scarce unless you
							finish off staggered demons with melee attacks. In
							concert, the player’s eyes and ears fire on all
							cylinders, picking priority targets and finding
							creative ways to leverage the densely arranged
							arenas. It just needs to stick to satanic horror.

						</p>
						<p>
							<i>Kirby</i>
							's first mainline post-Sakurai platformer is, much
							like the treasure it features, more interesting
							before you open it up. Below-par level design, an
							exceedingly short runtime, and recycled content
							aside, the few fresh ideas - chests of fanservice
							dotting the levels like
							<i>Amazing Mirror</i>
							, thieving mice enemies to race and battle, and a
							strikingly clunky inventory system for Kirby’s
							stomach - only mar the core gameplay’s pace and
							charms.
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>Squeak Squad</i>
							managing to fail without venturing beyond the
							shadows of its predecessors is not insignificant: it

							shallow, sowing doubt in

							brilliant, rambunctious compositions.

						<p>
							<i>Melody of Memory</i>
							not only sheds the mechanical baggage of its

							lineage, but commits to its own rhythmic pleasures
							by preserving the physicality of the mainline

							melodic responsibility throughout each track.

							Unsurprisingly, the experience degrades as it
							travels along the series timeline, Shimomura pushed
							aside for cinematic scenes that tie into the recent

							Having missed

							had taken since the original’s release 20 years ago.
							<i>LM3</i>
							's star is the ritzy resort setting that gives way
							to stratified cultural hubs on each floor, a la
							<i>Bioshock</i>
							, ramping up the high-budget spectacle at the
							expense of the original’s tempered density.
						</p>
						<p>
							Cooperative play is also wonderfully asymmetric, one
							player taking control of Luigi and the other the
							gelatinous Gooigi, but it never truly capitalizes on
							their ‘material’ differences. It’s caught halfway
							between an interesting multiplayer experiment and a
							frantic, body-swapping single-player experience, and
							falls just short of both.

							seem able to reign in the potential of the available

						</p>
						<p>
							Instead of real mechanical curiosity, the game
							revolves around a select few popular subgenres, most
							stemming from the masturbatory culture of

							the hardest, cheapest, trickiest levels imaginable.
							Even Nintendo, imitating the masses in the new story

						</p>
						<p>
							Marketed as an “elegantly designed puzzle game about
							chemistry,”
							<i>Sokobond</i>
							lives up to the billing. I enjoy the game’s title
							for its cheeky transparency: it is a series of
							clever wrinkles on the the classic
							<i>sokoban</i>
							block-pushing puzzler, but with a more interesting
							player goal of assembling, and thereby complicating,
							atomic structures that make traversal through the
							claustrophobic grids difficult.
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>Sokobond</i>
							’s cleverest quality is its clustered puzzle
							selection menu upon the Periodic Table, one that can
							be abstracted as a physical place - maybe a museum -
							with localized, iterating themes. Its presence turns
							the act of pushing circles into a journey.

						<p>
							It’s here that Duoyi find a compelling use of the
							roguelite format. Leveraging digestible play
							sessions (an hour max, a la
							<i>Monster Hunter</i>
							) and an expanding roster of characters with
							multiple playstyles each, the player is given
							opportunities for rapid, iterative, real-time build

							In particular, the recontextualization of the now

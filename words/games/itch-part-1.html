								In June 2020, an explosive month following the
								abhorrent and highly-televised murder of George
								Floyd by the Minneapolis Police Department, a
								group of over 1700 independent artists, game
								developers, writers, and programmers on Itch.io
								assembled a collection of their works with all
								proceeds split between the NAACP Legal Defense
								and Educational Fund and the Community Bail
								Fund.
							</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>
								Beyond an opportunity to show financial support
								for an unambiguously good cause, for me this
								bundle offered a place to jump into the weird
								world of independent, hobbyist game design that
								Itch represented as a platform. In November that
								same year, I delved into the works from the
								bundle that caught my eye - these are the ones
								that I felt compelled to write about in my month
								of exploration.
							</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>
								I want to mention that although some of these
								writings veer into harsh-ish criticism, these
								developers and many others like them deserve
								your support for their hard work. Independent
								designers and developers, on the whole, push the
								envelope in ways that bigger companies simply
								can't - without them, the medium as a whole is
								nothing.

							Upon booting up the game with no prior knowledge of
							what it contained,
							<i>Sandcastles</i>
							' concept and message are made immediately clear.
							You are free to build as many structures as you are
							able before the waves come by and they fall back
							into the ground... and the waves always come.
						</p>
						<p>
							The shockingly brief lifespan of your creations is
							provocative. My first thoughts were about how many
							real structures had been eroded by nature in the
							time humanity has inhabited the earth, how even what
							feels fortressed and impenetrable is eventually lost
							to time. I was next met with how much I appreciated
							the small personal touches to my castles - the
							twists, the bends, the warps - and how their
							existence felt more meaningful after they were gone.
							I was even confronted with my feelings of inadequacy
							in my own works of art, and how ultimately
							unimportant the flaws in them actually are, as they
							too will be washed away to rubble in turn.
						</p>
						<p>
							There's not much to the gameplay loop of
							<i>Sandcastles</i>
							, but it will leave a lasting impression on the
							player, as they reconsider their relationship with
							the impermanent.

						<p>
							It is difficult to find anything so easy to love as
							<i>Butterfly Soup</i>
							. A solo project by writer Brianna Lei, the game
							follows four young Asian-Americans through 2008, as
							they navigate their feelings, futures, and
							precarious relationships with their families. The
							cast of characters is multi-dimensional and feels
							fully-considered, with realistic stressors, desires,
							and worries. Yes, it is a visual novel, and yes,
							there is a level of commitment required of the
							player to stomach re-exposure to the most
							embarrassing bits of adolescence, but the thematic
							heft of the story is too powerful and joyous not to
							recommend.
						</p>
						<p>
							The emotional thread is the thin line between
							confusion and power that comes from identifying
							queerness in youth, but there’s so much more layered
							throughout: the hidden, carefully plotted acts of
							love as rebellion; the embrace of athletics as a
							social outlet and marker of personal growth; the
							dissonance of a personhood and public-facing persona
							that don’t align; and finally, the comfort of
							becoming yourself along with your loved ones,
							imperfections be damned.
							<i>Butterfly Soup</i>
							is a fully-realized vertical slice of adolescence,
							and it's brilliant.
						</p>
						<figure>
							<img src="../../img/games/itch-part-1/pom.png" />
							<figcaption>
								"your mom" jokes are some of the most powerful
								attacks in the game.
							</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							Lei’s first game,
							<i>Pom Gets Wi-Fi</i>
							, doesn’t hold the same charms. It’s a short
							parody-JRPG romp, wherein the titular Pom searches
							for a decent wi-fi connection in dog heaven. It’s
							filled to the brim with puns, backtracking, and 2013
							pop culture, and fatally, the writing relies far too
							heavily on then-trendy internet humor that’s
							unsurprisingly aged like milk.
						</p>
						<p>
							It occasionally shows an emotional side that would
							be greatly developed in
							<i>Butterfly Soup</i>
							(best of all being an observatory for the dogs to
							look down at their former owners on Earth), and the
							humor and length keep the experience fairly punchy,
							but the meme obsession ultimately overwhelms the
							experience. The concept is still novel and the
							presentation is charming, but at this point it’s
							best used as a time capsule of a simpler, more
							primitive era of internet culture.

						</figure>
						<p>
							<i>Far From Noise</i>
							is an unusual and refreshing narrative experience
							about a young woman stuck in a car teetering off the
							edge of a cliff. Unable to start the engine of the
							car because of its age, or to exit the vehicle
							without putting it in danger of falling, she hangs
							on the precipice of death, coming to terms with her
							life and the universe’s sense of humor.
						</p>
						<p>
							The grip of the premise is initially blunted by
							flimsy, unconvincing writing, but I was pleasantly
							surprised to see it settle in over time, as various
							scenes improve the woman’s mental state and clarify
							her words. The otherworldly stag - neither confirmed
							to be a real animal or a figment of the
							protagonist’s rightfully active imagination - is a
							wonderfully stoic character, bringing moments of
							real serenity as he binds the situation and all its
							absurdity to the beauty of nature and the stars. The
							use of "quiet space" between lines of text was
							excellent and set a meditative pace for the
							experience.
						</p>
						<p>
							You’re able to control some responses in
							conversation, but the hamhandedness of the choices
							keeps the player in the role of observer, absorbing
							the beauty and serenity second-hand from an
							arbitrary distance away. It invites you to share the
							moment, but never really makes an effort to bring
							you in. A deterministic structure might have been
							more affecting, but removing the only interactivity
							the game contains puts it closer to short film
							territory. Ultimately, Batchelor’s attempt at
							player-character synergy is a mixed bag, but even
							still,
							<i>Far From Noise</i>
							is a worthwhile exploration of absurdity, beauty,
							and peace.

							<figcaption>Cassie is all of us.</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							<i>Fortune-499</i>
							is a very compelling concept marred by some
							conflicting ideas of puzzle design and the core game
							mechanics. The game is about the manipulation of
							probability into fortuitous combat outcomes, but
							also about proving the value of one's work in a
							large corporation and the scant opportunity given to
							the miracle workers of the past as new management
							arrives.
						</p>
						<p>
							The boring office setting is the stage of a demonic
							siege, and the literal probability wizard Cassie
							must travel to various floors to wipe out monsters
							like an IT admin completing service tickets. Cassie
							is witty and likeable, refusing to get into
							conflicts with monsters "off the clock" and teasing
							humanity's poor understanding of probability as a
							whole. Fights are riffs on rock-paper-scissors,
							using cards that influence the enemy's chances to
							choose one of rock, paper, or scissors to the
							player's benefit.
						</p>
						<p>
							The idea of manipulating your enemy’s actions is
							clever, but the riffs on the mechanics become more
							grating and reset-heavy as as they require more
							precision. In one example, I had to intentionally
							lose a fight with an auditor boss to balance my
							win-loss ratio on the current floor and move on, but
							I was powerful enough to kill the boss in one hit
							while it needed to hit me upwards of 10 times before
							I died. In another, a three-pronged monster required
							me to precisely avoid death and bring each limb to 1
							HP before finding a card that would prematurely end
							the fight. In both cases, randomness was the
							dividing line between success and failure.
						</p>
						<p>
							The amount of deck experimentation required, the
							tedium of finding the solutions, and the pointless
							cost of failure are baffling decisions for a about
							influencing probability. Structuring battles around
							fixed desired outcomes (with punishment for failure)
							is a refusal from Thomson to play ball with his own
							concept of probability not reliable as a proxy for
							truth or certainty. Regardless, I'm looking forward
							to checking out the creator's other works as the
							major ideas, style, and pro-worker politics driving
							<i>Fortune-499</i>
							are attention-grabbing.

						<p>
							A soberingly exploration of the American socialist
							movement,
							<i>Democratic Socialism Simulator</i>
							offers a glimpse at the sheer immensity of the power
							structures witholding progress toward a better
							society in America by inviting you to the driver’s
							seat in the Oval Office. Cheekily, it doubles as an
							ego check for many players (including myself) who
							balk at the ineffectiveness of even the “good”
							public officials. What a horrific job!
						</p>
						<p>
							With enemies in both parties and the press, and the
							everpresent tick of the clock, you will find not
							every item on the moral platform can be addressed
							without the risk of a coup, assassination,
							impeachment, or losing your job, and those events
							happen much more quickly than you might expect. You
							may also be confronted by cabinet members (and
							public figures such as the union leader) who take
							issue with your approach or your priorities, and the
							feedback they provide helped check me on more than a
							few of my poor or uninformed decisions.
						</p>
						<p>
							My gripes with the experience are all mechanical,
							namely that assumptions that can be made if you have
							some awareness of government institutions can lead
							to unanticipated mistakes. Most egregiously, cutting
							big chunks out of the military budget would free up
							hundreds of billions of dollars annually in real
							life, but in-game it took the form of a
							not-so-large, single-time payment. This blunts the
							realism of the situation and can take theoretically
							viable governing strategies off of the table, but I
							also acknowledge that the game is a thought
							experiment first and foremost, and it doesn’t take
							away from the messaging as a whole.
						</p>
						<p>
							Despite the game’s difficulty, I don't believe
							Molleindustria's Paolo Pedercini argues for an
							incrementalist approach, far from it. The lesson is
							in the enormity of the task that is liberation from
							within, that American politics is fraught with
							enemies of the working class, that the system itself
							is designed to eject those who dare to side with the
							masses. This is an educational game about shedding
							enthusiasm for reformation politics, and its honesty
							should be celebrated.

						<p>
							<i>Minit</i>
							is a series of 1-minute escapades into a Legend of
							Zelda-style world. Your objective is to venture out
							to explore and make incremental progress in quests
							before you die and wake up back at home with only
							your inventory preserved, a la
							<i>Majora’s Mask</i>
							. The pace is snappy and lighthearted, the game
							ushering you around its map and teasing areas you’ll
							have to remember to visit on your future runs.
						</p>
						<p>
							The actual happenings of the world are secondary to
							the cutesy characters and striking 1-bit
							presentation, so its short length caught me by
							surprise. Our hero is cursed by the sword they find
							early in the game, trapping them in their Groundhog
							Day time-loop, but since the character’s motivations
							are kept hidden and the player’s familiarity with
							the world is so limited, what to do, how to do it,
							and what you’re even trying to accomplish in the
							longterm is obscured.
						</p>
						<p>
							Replacing it is the moment-to-moment decision making
							and execution of miniature quests, most all of which
							will push up very close to your 60-second timer of
							existence. There’s always something to do, so much
							so that I ended up focusing on micro-task after
							micro-task until suddenly the credits started
							rolling. Without a marker of overall progress, it’s
							easy to feel like a much larger experience is being
							signaled to the player.
						</p>
						<p>
							Worst of all is that the timer doesn’t lend itself
							to any challenges that require thinking outside of
							the linear-time box, and in fact outside of a small
							quest to repeatedly water a plant at the beginning
							of the game, repeated attempts at something are not
							required for progression. The result of this is a
							time mechanic that encourages hurried play, but not
							thoughtful play. Some of the puzzles are frantic and
							fun, and the writing has a dry wit that I enjoyed,
							but when everything moves at the pace demanded of
							you in Minit, it's hard to appreciate much of
							anything.

						<p>
							LYNE is a puzzle game wherein you trace lines
							through various sets of shapes, minding the number
							of times you pass through shared hub slots that
							accept any line color but in limited quantities.
							This is a simple concept in theory but the puzzles
							can get quite tricky without ever expanding in
							actual size - everything is kept to a tidy 4x3 grid,
							at least as far as I've gotten. The interface is as
							intuitive as it gets for mobile platforms, the game
							itself very similar to unlocking an Android phone.
						</p>
						<p>
							My major greivance is that while it's a nice brain
							teaser, I don't ever feel like I'm taking lessons
							away from the act of solving a puzzle. There are
							surely "tricks of the trade" that are meant to be
							learned, but with such an abstract interface and
							concept they have been lost on me. On many occasions
							the first combination of lines I entered happened to
							be the correct answer, so I'm not sure how much
							explicit planning is required when I can gut-feel my
							way through the game. This flaw make it a merely
							passable puzzler - without a consistent set of
							twists, I'm left perpetually unsurprised.

						</figure>
						<p>
							Directors Elizabeth Maler and Rafael
							Martinez-Jausoro have assembled one of the cleverest
							game concepts I have seen in some time.
							<i>A Normal Lost Phone</i>
							takes place on an Android-esque smartphone, with an
							obvious hook: you want to find the phone’s owner,
							Sam, and return their phone. To this end, the player
							must rifle through messages, emails, photos, and
							forum posts, sometimes with intimate and private
							details never meant for the public eye.
						</p>
						<p>
							The game’s ambiguous goals give a relaxed pace, but
							spending time in a realistic world that isn't yours
							can feel invasive. I was captivated by the mystery
							surrounding Sam, and scoured for details to help me
							solve it, but in doing so I was confronted by my own
							willingness to cross boundaries, especially ones in
							place to protect people from harm. It’s powerful and
							sobering, and could’ve easily felt less impactful if
							the interface was less lifelike.
						</p>
						<p>
							The game’s interface also creates powerful moments
							of diegesis. The soundtrack - a smattering of
							delicate, quaint indie pop - felt out of place to me
							until I realized it was actually playing from the
							in-game Music app. Such a simple and obvious choice,
							but surprising in its novelty. Using each app to
							find their related information feels just like
							normal daily life, whether it’s to zoom in on
							pictures to identify people or rummaging through old
							conversations for information. Not everything is
							intuitive; some apps have passwords that must be
							discovered, but they’re not just exclusively
							numeric, they’re by and large cryptic or irrelevant
							to the story. Progression isn't tied to your learned
							knowledge of Sam's life, but to dates and zip codes
							that are tangentially related. It stands out as a
							particularly game-y thing in a game that hardly
							feels like one.
						</p>
						<p>
							It has its problems, but
							<i>A Normal Lost Phone</i>
							is tasteful, contemporary, and tells its own story
							with wit, confidence, warmth and pacing. What it
							should be remembered for, though, is the unspoken
							epiphanies of its storytelling vehicle - the
							inherent intrusiveness of altruism, opportunistic
							indulgence in the secret lives of others, vicarious
							projection of our social lives via the digital
							portals at our fingertips, the divide between
							private and public appearance and identity. This is
							what modernity in storytelling looks like.

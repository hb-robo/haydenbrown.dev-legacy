            <p>
              Released in 2004 for the PlayStation 2, Katamari Damacy has become
              famous for a few things: a brilliant soundtrack popular even with
              those who haven't played it; a colorful, surrealist art direction;
              and a core concept both intuitive and bizarre. Katamari roughly
              translates to “clump” in English, and as you might expect, the
              game is about rolling your clump around, collecting everything you
              can see until it’s sufficiently large.
            </p>
            <p>
              What elevates this simple idea is not only the context of humans
              as the playerbase, who are intimately familiar with the objects
              and structures that can be collected, but also a presentation that
              delights in the chaos you unfold. The player is treated to a
              whirlwind of jazzy bubblegum electronica, bright pastel colors,
              and unfettered, wanton destruction - it’s a complete sensory
              overload, and one that is fueled almost entirely by play, making
              it impossible to replicate in any other medium.
            </p>
            <p>
              The player’s role as the Prince is a daunting one: you must
              rebuild all of the stars in the night sky after your father, the
              ostentatious King of the Cosmos, destroys them on a whim. True to
              the fragility of the omnipotent, the King laments the stars’
              absence in the just after destroying the last one, and tasks you
              with collecting enough stuff from Earth to use as material to
              rebuild the cosmos. Your trusty katamari is used to roll up
              objects, people, and creatures of all sorts, indiscriminately
              taking raw matter regardless of its intended purpose or sentience.
            </p>
            <p>
              The catch is that the King of the Cosmos is an allegedly busy guy
              and he only gives you a handful of minutes to create a ball of a
              given diameter, making where to go and what to pick up a series of
              continuous, frantic mental decisions for the entirety of the
              stage. You control your ball of stuff with the two analog sticks,
              each vaguely representing the Prince’s hands, and barrel through
              the environment before you in the time allotted.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>
              The sense of scale and perspective was the first thing that grabs
              you. The tutorial level takes place atop a kotatsu, the player
              rolling up candies and matchsticks and dominoes as the size of one
              themselves. As the levels go by, you either start from or are
              given more time to reach a larger diameter for your katamari, and
              this naturally changes the bounds of the area - eventually
              tackling the rest of the house, the yard, the local neighborhood,
              the nearby cities and finally entire islands in the sea.
            </p>
            <p>
              This scale is emphasized in gameplay with an extremely literal
              mass hierarchy. For each of the game’s myriad of things, there is
              a hidden minimum diameter needed to attach it to your katamari -
              any attempt to accumulate it before reaching that threshold will
              aggressively bounce you away. Crucially, nothing in the entire
              game is exempt from this rule - out of the hundreds of thousands
              of objects in this game, they either are yours to take now or
              later, it’s just a matter of becoming large enough to do so.
            </p>
            <p>
              This gives way to some creative level structures, where areas in a
              stage can be "zoned off" until later simply by containing too many
              of an item you can't pick up yet, giving a semi-intended route
              though these otherwise unbounded playgrounds. A personal favorite
              of mine is an alleyway with bowling pins, which both stands as an
              initially imposing phalanx for the player’s progress in the area,
              and also perfectly congratulates the player in a fun way the
              instant they are able to be bowled through.
            </p>
            <figure>

                surprisingly, I did not make this, but this is what it feels
                like.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              It’s easy to see yourself as something of a nuisance in the early
              stages, running amok in some poor soul’s house, stealing their
              waste and belongings. There are much larger structures you must
              abide by as the bounds of the stage, and any living creature poses
              a threat to you, smacking you away and knocking some clumped
              objects off of your katamari in the process. However, this concept
              comes full circle in an entirely logical and empowering way.
            </p>
            <p>
              A fairly universal experience with the game that I’ve noticed is
              that everyone remembers their first encounter with a cat. They are
              the most aggressive obstacle early in the game, running up to you
              if they see you - and why wouldn’t they when your clump looks like
              a toy tailor-made for them? It smacks you around a little until it
              gets bored and walks off, as cats do. Starting from stage 3,
              however, there is enough stuff and a long enough time limit on the
              stage to roll around this large loop and come back to the cat
              large enough to cause it to start running away from you, turning
              the previous dynamic of the encounter on its head - the cat has
              become a plaything for you, fodder for your mission.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the later levels, the sense of destruction you're causing can
              become intoxicating. Similar role reversals to the cat occur
              throughout the game with human beings in a small outdoor
              marketplace, cars on a loop of highway, and finally ships and
              military vessels that choose to blast away at the incomprehensible
              clump of stuff put before them - a funny, depressing, terminally
              human conclusion. Overcoming your obstacles through sheer heft
              feels good in a primal sort of way, as you stage a literal
              conquest of the environment before you. Soon enough, you'll pluck
              islands from the sea like you're waxing hair off of your body.
            </p>

            <p>
              From a gameplay perspective, the most difficult thing to do at any
              given time is to simply get a reign on this massive thing you’re
              pushing about. The katamari is controlled with the analog sticks
              exclusively - if both sticks point in any direction the ball will
              roll that way, if they are opposite of one another, the camera
              rotates either clockwise or counter-clockwise to create a new
              trajectory. This in and of itself does not pose any special
              consideration from the player - if the game had simply visually
              applied the objects collected while maintaining a perfectly
              spherical collision area, there wouldn’t be much challenge, it’d
              be like setting a quickly growing Super Monkey Ball character
              loose in the game world - perfect responsiveness from every angle
              and in every direction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Katamari Damacy upends this by physically sticking the model to
              your katamari in a way that the object’s previous collision data
              is now an extension of yours in the exact way it was initially
              touched. This has some interesting consequences - one comes early
              on in the form of any number of utility poles and streetlamps as
              they stick to your katamari in an asymmetric way, becoming an
              impedance to your movement. However, because the katamari’s radial
              velocity is preserved, this also has the useful side effect of
              being able to leverage that new arm as a sort of pole vault,
              reaching higher locations. This is never once required of the
              player, but its consequences as both a hindrance and advantage are
              completely emergent, the outcome dependent on the way in which the
              player collects the item in question.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are other interesting examples as well. Rolling atop a row
              of aligned, uniformly spaced items - a shelf of books, for
              instance - applies them radially around the katamari, giving it a
              shape more akin to a wheel or disc. Like with the poles from
              before, you may try to ignore this constraint and wobble around,
              eventually filling the shallower sides, but you could also lean
              into the temporary advantages of your new state and barrel through
              the level like a loose tire. Again, this is completely emergent -
              some items are set up in a way to encourage these strange shapes,
              but the direction the player hits them from can’t be guaranteed,
              and so each instance of it is quasi-random and driven entirely by
              the player. This simple moment-to-moment difference in control can
              make repeated runs through the same level feel very different from
              one another.
            </p>
            <figure>
              <img src="../../img/games/katamari/rolling.gif" />
              <figcaption>
                you can see here how rolling up these two weirdos complicates
                the geometry.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Mercifully, Katamari Damacy does not fall into the pitfalls of
              stuffy 3D platforming completionism that could have plagued the
              game if helmed by another development team. The natural step
              forward in the gamification of a katamari is to go from collect
              “enough” to collect everything, but this is never required of you,
              and in fact I think it’s deliberately avoided as much as possible.
              In addition to the time constraint - which is tight enough to
              encourage you to leave areas with items that are too small to
              meaningfully increase your katamari’s size - there is also a sort
              of mass tier system, where reaching certain katamari size
              thresholds will pan the camera out and de-load the smaller objects
              while loading in far-off areas that are now accessible with a
              little more effort.
            </p>
            <p>
              This has the unfortunate side effect of transforming a certain
              inner radius of your katamari into a generic sphere again, keeping
              the most recently collected items intact, which somewhat dulls the
              emergent movement discusses early. However, it’s pretty
              unreasonable for the game to have to keep track of the exact
              collision of the thousands of miniscule objects you’ve
              accumulated, and in its defense these load sequences only happen a
              handful of times even on the longest levels. This is a necessary
              constraint in order to achieve the spectacle of the gameplay
              itself - you can’t grow your clump from cat toy to the size of a
              small building without acknowledging that some items are simply
              too insignificant for the console to care about anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
              In an exaggerated example, the marketplace where you spend most of
              Level 5 is connected to the house you begin the game in by a steep
              road. If you gain enough size and have enough time remaining in
              the stage, you can roll back up the road and pluck the entire
              house right out of the ground as a single object. The kotatsu you
              start the game atop of is no longer large enough to even be
              perceived as something picked up. Outside of being incredibly
              empowering to the player, this dynamic scale and time limit
              naturally disincentivizes a completionist approach to the game
              because collecting everything requires a playstyle that slows the
              katamari’s growth as much as possible, which is in direct
              opposition to the win condition.
            </p>
            <p>
              I think a way to articulate the elegance of these constraints is
              that they paradoxically wrap around again in the form of freedom -
              you are not bound by the natural impulses and habits that games
              teach you, and instead you are free in the most literal sense to
              move as quickly as possible and be as sloppy as you like, every
              item and creature vying for your destructive attention. There are
              no style points here, and the game actively rejects any
              methodological approach by the player, instead reveling in the
              mess.
            </p>

                does this look like a game built to accomodate tradition?

            </figure>
            <p>
              The sound design in Katamari Damacy not only enhances this feeling
              of freedom but elevates it to outright catharsis. There is a
              plucky little sound effect whenever you pick something up that
              randomly deviates in pitch. Approaching a large number of objects
              causes the sound to play in a satisfying burst, and it gets better
              the larger you grow. If your katamari is sufficiently large to
              just touch both sides of a busy street, you may hear this sound
              hundreds of times as you roll down the way, making you feel like
              you’re making progress in your rate of accumulation - a comically
              literal instance of the snowball effect.
            </p>
            <p>
              The presence or absence of the little “chunk” noise can also help
              you indicate whether the area you’re in is a smart one to be in,
              as the sparseness or density of useful objects that can be picked
              up can be felt just by rolling around and listening for the sound.
              Entering an area initially rich with items to pick up and cleaning
              it out until there’s hardly anything left to grab also gives the
              impression that you’ve sort of tidied up the place, like when a
              vacuum cleaner stops rattling.

              Katamari Damacy’s universally acclaimed soundtrack also strongly
              benefits the overall experience, setting a fantastical tone and -
              bewilderingly - doing right by the game’s core themes in its
              design. It draws from a suitably vast set of influences by
              incorporating a large number of musicians who each made their own
              tracks, as if trying to match the katamari you build. Instead of
              feeling patchwork, though, it has a cohesive quality thanks to its
              playful nature and emphasis on uptempo rhythms, giving a pace to
              the player’s actions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The musical direction primarily draws from shibuya-kei, a style of
              Japanese pop from the 90s: it’s something like a modern, jazzier
              take on traditional pop music, incorporating both electronic and
              orchestral elements in equal part to feel fresh and futuristic.
              Its emphasis on fusion and creating something new from pieces of
              old is quite fitting for a game about turning manmade objects into
              stars. Katamari isn’t wholly derivative, though, and in some
              regards it was actually quite hip at the time.

              You can find bits and pieces of early 2000s lounge revival, the
              emerging Japanese glitch pop scene, samba and flamenco, tech
              house, IDM, vocal jazz, Michael Bolton, j-rap, and what I have
              come to call “miniature electronics” a la Daedelus or Shlohmo (let
              me know if there is a real name for this). All this is to say that
              Katamari Damacy isn’t just well composed and interesting for its
              time, it was also ahead of or up to date with musical trends at
              its release.

              The varied score might seem at odds with the gameplay premise,
              which is so perfectly singular and consistent, but in a stroke of
              utter brilliance, the soundtrack itself is not meant to color the
              moment-to-moment gameplay (although it often does) - it is also an
              exploration of how musical responses to the katamari would play
              out in real life. The vocal tracks are often self-referential,
              flamboyantly posing the music as a creation of the alternative
              polygonal Earth you play in.

              Ballads about both the katamari and the one rolling it gives the
              impression that the player, through their actions with their clump
              of chaos, has become the ultimate muse for artists everywhere.
              Interestingly, their work never strays into nihilism, instead
              tenderly exploring the event as a frame or metaphor for their own
              emotions and desires. This could be cynically dismissed as a
              branding effort, like when the Tellytubbies sing their own names,
              but the effort put into the arrangements and the way the lyrics
              explore the katamari’s place in the world is simply too
              well-considered for me to leave it at that.

              Here is just a smattering of the lyrical content: a semi-conscious
              rap about getting caught up in the power of the Katamari and
              regretting the destruction caused; a wistful longing for the
              person rolling the katamari, arguably the player; the fatalist
              romanticization of two lovers being pulled into the katamari
              together; the exploration of being turned into a star by the
              katamari as wish fulfillment; the sexualization of being consumed
              by a katamari [NOT A JOKE]; a nostalgic memory of following the
              katamari around as a child as a metaphor for adolesencent naivety;
              and finally, heartfelt optimism that the katamari is the great
              equalizer, something that finally brings humanity together and
              teaches them to love one another in their brief final moments
              before becoming a star in the sky.

              I strongly doubt there will ever be this deep of a musical
              exploration of a game’s concept again. The songs actually being
              catchy, well-produced, and fairly unique in gaming on top of it
              all sells this completely - and this point’s relative obscurity is
              an unfortunate consequence of the language barrier for the West. I
              have never heard music for any game that manages to sound as
              fitting in game, as interesting out of game, and create its own
              striking identity as well as Katamari Damacy’s, and as far as I’m
              concerned this is among the best original soundtracks ever made in
              any medium.

              Series creator Keita Takahashi has spoken about Katamari as a
              critique of consumerist culture, and I think that lens is the best
              way to understand the game's vision. The number of different
              objects that can be rolled up is staggering, and even through
              hours of gameplay there will certainly be some that you haven't
              seen yet. The Collection page lets you take a look at everything
              you’ve ever rolled up, and while many players might look through
              it fondly, remembering their adventures as the Prince, I can’t
              help but think about how much work it must’ve been to make all of
              models. It seems the hardest part of making a critique of
              consumerism is properly recreating the staggering amount of things
              the earth has.
            </p>
            <p>
              The result of this fittingly quantity-focused approach is a
              surrealist, brightly-colored art direction that is what I’d call
              tastefully low-poly. The pastels in the palette work nicely with
              the soft blur from the SD output of the PS2, giving the visuals a
              warm quality, and the choice for a stylized simplification over
              realism surely made the task of modeling all of these things less
              daunting for the art team.

              At the end of each stage, The King of the Cosmos lambasts or
              praises you based on your collection efforts, but will always end
              his monologue with the same line: "My, Earth really is full of
              things." It is up to interpretation if this is meant to represent
              some divine condescension of mankind's relentless hoarding, or a
              critique of the actual utility of most things in their current
              state outside of kindling for a boulder of stuff, or a more
              abstract desire of the creator to channel his distaste for the
              manufacturing of useless trinkets that comprise a majority of our
              landfills, to literally shoot all of this garbage into space,
              where it may actually be of use for something, and to clean our
              planet of their presence.

              The fact that the people who helped create all of these things are
              commonly caught in the mayhem serves only to amplify the stance,
              whether you see those acts of abduction to be punishment for
              mankind or an act no different than picking up anything else.
              Perhaps it's even justifiable as an alleviation of a burden on the
              Earth itself.

              On a smaller narrative scale, you learn of a human perspective on
              the events taking place through small cutscenes of the Hoshino
              family, who witness the Katamari as they travel across the country
              to see the astronaut father launch his rocket to the moon. The
              kids see news stories about stars disappearing and reappearing,
              and even catch glimpses of the King himself, but their mother
              always just misses these scenes and refuses to believe such
              ridiculous stories. Inevitably, the adults are forced to accept
              the situation when the father's launch is canceled after the moon
              can no longer be found in the night sky - a reconstruction project
              that you as the Prince just hadn't gotten to yet.

              This second story gives an interesting perspective of childlike
              wonder on your anti-consumerist crusade, re-contextualizing the
              game as what it appears to be at first glance - a fantastical
              mythos of childish imagination. Katamari Damacy is both the work
              of a discontent adult, disgusted with the planet around him, and
              the boy he once was, wide-eyed for stories of the otherworldly.

            <p>
              Some additional perspective on the events of the game comes from
              the player - despite being an alien, totally separated from the
              day-to-day life of Earth, the Prince is of course meant to be
              controlled by a human. The contrast between how the Prince and
              King feel about the surplus of useless stuff littered about the
              face of the Earth and how the player feels as they do the
              collecting is in itself commentary.
            </p>
            <p>
              The dissonance, if there is any, questions the utility of the
              things the player will see everywhere they go, every day. Perhaps
              your katamari takes away something meaningful to your real life,
              like an artbook or a game console. Perhaps the player is a
              businessman by trade, and in the game he abducts dozens of suited
              salarymen, maybe even an entire office. The point isn’t
              necessarily to discard what you care about or who you are, but to
              offer a cosmic perspective on their relative insignificance.
              Katamari Damacy isn’t just an absurd game, it’s an absurd-IST one,
              recognizing that the world is chaotic and arbitrary.
            </p>
            <p>
              Seeing a city picked clean off the ground makes one wonder about
              how the land of their own neighborhood might look if a big space
              clump took it away instead. Maybe this sounds like pointless
              nonsense to you, but it is significant as a form of therapy. Many
              people, our neighbors and family included, struggle with the
              pointless cruelty of the world we inhabit. Billions of people
              alive today will live their entire lives fighting through it.
              Although the game doesn’t offer an alternative to the human
              condition, it does inspire wonder about how different it could all
              be, and how things came to be this way.

            <p>
              Katamari Damacy achieves the complete actualization of its concept
              in so many regards it feels impossible that it was created by such
              a species as flawed as humans - especially if you consider the
              apathetic attitude the game has towards mankind’s material
              obsessions. At the same time, it is possibly the most beautifully
              human game ever made, a thorough exploration of all things joyful,
              wondrous, and freeing. For a game as superficially destructive as
              this, that element is something enormously difficult to retain.
            </p>
            <p>
              Katamari Damacy manages to fulfill the player’s desire to bring
              chaos to order and to make order from chaos simultaneously. These
              parallel concepts result in something that feels close to the Law
              of Conservation of Matter - we cannot create matter from nothing,
              nor destroy it to the point of nonexistence. We can only change
              its form, repurposing it for some cosmic ideal. You don’t have to
              dig too far to figure out what else is being conserved in this
              process, either. Katamari might mean “clump,” but Damacy means
              “soul,” and that’s exactly what the game has in spades.

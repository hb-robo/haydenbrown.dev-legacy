								By early 2020, games writing had become a
								constant in my life. When the pandemic hit, it
								was a place of solace for me, a mental space
								impervious to pain and grief. This is a
								chronological, lightly edited sample of the
								(finished) write-ups from that year. Some of
								these were written for and published on
								Glitchwave.com, and as such the tone is more
								casual and explanatory.
							</i>
						</p>
						<h2 id="subtitle">Celeste (2018) - ★★★½</h2>
						<p id="subtitle">
							<i>dev. Extremely OK Games, dir. Maddy Thorson</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							I bought a Switch recently, partially to play the
							exclusives, but mostly as a convenient way to
							portably catch up on all of the 8th gen indies I
							skipped out on.
							<i>Celeste</i>
							was $10 for the Winter Sale and I decided that the
							critical reception was too strong to not take the
							plunge. While I definitely have my grievances with
							the title, a majority lie with my own skill level,
							and I respect the hell out of the devs for creating
							such a finely-tuned experience.
						</p>
						<p>
							The crux of the game is jumping, dashing, and
							climbing through cleverly designed rooms of
							challenges, with optional difficulty increases by
							way of the strawberry collectables. Touching
							anything dangerous is instant death, but you respawn
							at the beginning of each room as quickly as you went
							out. This creates a fast-paced, player-friendly
							environment to try riskier things in a way where you
							aren't punished for dying. The rooms navigate into
							each other in a map-like way, giving an overall stag
							more cohesiveness than something like
							<i>Super Meat Boy</i>
							, where all challenges are divorced from one
							another. Occasionally, a room may even present two
							different challenges depending on the direction
							traveled.
						</p>
						<p>
							There are also something like a dozen mechanics that
							expand the "vocabulary" of the level design to make
							it both more interesting and more difficult to
							traverse. There are mechanical blocks that shoot off
							when you grab them, space goo that preserves your
							dash momentum indefinitely, bubbles that serve as
							vehicles until you dash out of them, blocks that you
							can steer while grabbing onto them, Thwompoids that
							speed off in the direction you dash into them from,
							and the feather, which allows you to temporarily fly
							in any direction and navigate tricky spike mazes.
							It's all nonsense and some of the setups really,
							really push your abilities - not only to figure out
							how to get through the room, but then to execute
							your plan as well. Little hard-to-miss wrinkles get
							thrown in that cause you to rethink your strategies,
							and you slowly master the room on the way to beating
							it. It's really rewarding and feels set up like a
							classroom to teach you how to improve at the game.
						</p>
						<p>
							For those who like a challenge, the difficulty gets
							pushed up to crazy heights on the B- and C-Sides for
							each level, which feature remixed music and
							challenge rooms. While I haven't personally
							completed all of them, some were occasionally so
							difficult that I would spent upwards of 10 minutes
							just practicing a room until I miraculously broke
							through and pulled it off. Getting through the whole
							thing feels fantastic, but I didn't really
							appreciate the decision to make the B-Sides mirror
							the length of the original levels - some are much
							longer than others, and at many points, I had felt
							like I'd already earned the reward of the level
							coming to an end. Personally, I like to take on
							high-stress challenges in bite-sized chunks - others
							may feel differently, so I can't call it a firm
							critique.
						</p>
						<figure class="dotted-line-above">
							<img src="../../img/games/saw-20/celeste (2).gif" />
							<figcaption>
								this room took me at least 45 minutes of
								straight grinding to get that strawberry.
							</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							Aesthetically, I applaud the choice to embrace such
							an odd palette -
							<i>Celeste</i>
							is filled with purples, oranges, yellows, teal, and,
							of course, the ever-present auburn of Madeline's
							hair centering it all. The pixel art, though fairly
							classical, is just chunky enough to give the
							animation some ambiguity and heft. Some may lament
							the non-pixelated text boxes and portraits as well
							as the low-poly 3D main menu, clashing with the
							low-res gameplay, but overall I consider those
							critiques unimportant because all three styles
							capture the main art direction well. It was quite
							cool to see some major landmarks from the 2D stages
							on the 3D mountain model after I'd overcome them.
						</p>
						<p>
							The music is fun and energetic, especially in the
							final stage of the game, but personally I'd put it
							in the "good, not great" category for some missteps
							- notably the Chapter 4 B-Side which was so grating
							and repetitive I had to turn it off. The sound
							design is great, and it helps you figure out timing
							on later, more complex areas by slowly figuring out
							what a successful run would sound like... and that's
							powerful stuff. It really weaves well into the
							internally-focused structure of the gameplay.
						</p>
						<p>
							I know the narrative is somewhat controversial, and
							I'll be upfront and say that I didn't care for it.
							Madeline herself is the star of the show and is very
							likable for her short temper and generally
							introverted personality - since you control her,
							it's easier to fit into her shoes even during her
							low points. She's honest about her feelings, and
							seeing her slowly overcome her emotional burdens is
							gratifying and a strong point of player motivation.
							However, the game's insistence on using flatter
							characters to build Madeline up through her arc
							really detracts from the overall narrative.
						</p>
						<p>
							Theo is framed as her fun, pseudo-foil sidekick that
							she opens up to, but he comes across as
							self-absorbed and frankly unhelpful. Madeline's
							vulnerability can't be inferred, we have to listen
							to her phone call with an ex to reveal that to us.
							Her obvious stubbornness can't be taken at the face
							value it is presented in, it has to be revealed to
							them through a sequence where she tries to save a
							rude ghost from... something? The execution on
							basically everything is poor except for Madeline
							herself. It's not that large a part of the game
							overall, but it does prevent full unity from the
							player and the game. If you trim the character fat
							to the old woman, more frequent calls to home, and
							the "internal" monologues with her darker side,
							you're gold. For a game about overcoming anxiety and
							loneliness, Madeline doesn't get many narrative
							moments to herself, either. The plot could really
							welcomed the same laser-focus present in the rest of
							the experience.
						</p>
						<p>
							In all, it's very difficult for me to not recommend
							Celeste, despite its shortcomings, because the base
							game is just so fundamentally sound. If you have
							basically any interest in platformers, this is a
							must-play. If you have no previous experience with
							them but want a starting point, well I can't really
							dissuade you from Celeste either, for as difficult
							as it becomes, it's very manageable and teaches you
							the ropes organically. This is a great stepping
							stone for the developers and I hope their next
							project gets closer to the potential Celeste
							reveals.

							Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei (1987) - ★☆☆☆
						</h2>
						<p id="subtitle">
							<i>dev. ATLUS, dir. Kouji Okada</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							In recent weeks, I have made the very poor decision
							to jump into the sprawling MegaTen series, my OCD
							unnecessarily landing me here at the beginning with
							the original
							<i>Megami Tensei</i>
							. I'm an English-only speaker and rely heavily on
							the restless work of fan translators, and they have
							been busting their ass to reveal this series to
							Westerners as it was meant to be. However, the only
							English version of the original Megami Tensei games
							are the SNES remasters on the compilation
							<i>Kyūyaku Megami Tensei</i>
							, so that's the version I'll be referring to from
							here on.
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>Megami Tensei</i>
							is a rather pure old-school dungeon crawler RPG with
							some odd core mechanics that set it apart from its
							contemporaries. The first is the theme of a
							modern-day apocalypse, wherein malicious demons are
							set upon the earth by a computer program written by
							one Akemi Nakajima. Stricken with guilt, he and his
							magical friend Yumiko descend the Tower of Daedalus
							to defeat the demon lords Set and Loki, recently
							freed, and Lucifer himself. Pretty strange setup,
							but that's all from the manual. Outside of a few
							minuscule morsels of NPC dialogue and the
							appearances of the bosses themselves, it's hard to
							tell that this is what's going on. A lot is left to
							the imagination, and to call it a plot is fairly
							generous. Strange enemy design and themes give an
							appropriately wicked atmosphere, but it's all sort
							of jumbled together.
						</p>
						<figure class="dotted-line-above">
							<img src="../../img/games/saw-20/mt1.webp" />
							<figcaption>
								this box art is so intensely 80s J-pulp that it

							</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							Monsters pop up with random encounters, but you
							aren't required to fight them. Many can speak,
							allowing you to convince them to walk away or join
							you. The system is incredibly barebones and a few
							tactical recruitment options, such as smiling or
							walking towards them, do nothing at all. Recruiting
							demons either boils down to purchasing their
							services or just outleveling them so bad that they
							join out of fear. A few interesting scenarios arise
							from this, namely the fact that speaking with a
							group of demons of the same type as one you've
							already recruited ends the confrontation peacefully,
							sometimes with some rewards. You can also be mislead
							by some of the trickier demons, who will feign
							interest in joining to rob you of your resources and
							leave.
						</p>
						<p>
							This negotiation system is helpful when you run into
							posses of demons that pose a significant threat to
							your party, and prevents a lot of headaches, even
							with its simplicity. Fighting on its own isn't too
							interesting, however, just simple turn-based action
							with physical and magical attacks, but you don't
							pick which demon you target which can lead to some
							annoyances in terms of target prioritization. The
							biggest encounter frustration has more to do with
							the overall pacing, though.
						</p>
						<p>
							Like many NES-era dungeon crawlers, you're left to
							your own wits about how to proceed through the mazes
							before you. There are some elements of complexity to
							the layout, especially with how they utilize
							vertical forks in the road, but the big hangup is
							how little there is out there to discover. Treasure
							is exceedingly rare and the maps are riddled with
							dead ends with trap encounters - a few leveled so
							high that your party's wiping is nearly guaranteed.
							This is counter-intuitive beyond all belief, as it
							disincentives you to look around each corner.
							Mercifully, the SNES version has an automap, but the
							original won't even spare you that, which is another
							level of sadism I wouldn't be able to put up with.
						</p>
						<p>
							The environments are also all nearly identical,
							making it tricky to get your bearings. I cannot deny
							that the act of simply filling the map out is
							satisfying unto itself, but the pace of exploration
							you're going to want to make is completely at odds
							with the leveling progression the game expects. When
							I first encountered the Minotaur at the bottom of
							the tower, my party was level 11 with two major
							demons recruited at levels 10 and 17, respectively.
							The boss, however, was level 27, and was able to
							wipe my party almost instantly - and that's with the
							entire map uncovered and multiple trips made back up
							top to the town to upgrade equipment and fuse
							demons. The amount of pointless grinding
							<i>MT1</i>
							dawns on you is nothing short of cruel, and it
							undermines the fun of uncovering the map to begin
							with.
						</p>
						<p>
							In all, the most fun I had with
							<i>MT1</i>
							was seeing the stylistic and mechanical origins of a
							really interesting series and filling out a map that
							wasn't even available in the original. I can enjoy a
							simpler RPG experience like this from time to time,
							but MT1 seems discontent with you making your own
							fun. I can't recommend a game that wants you to
							waste your time, the context of its existence as
							compelling as it is.

						<h2 id="subtitle">Super Mario 3D Land (2011) - ★★★☆</h2>
						<p id="subtitle">
							<i>
								dev. Nintendo EAD Tokyo, dir. Koichi Hayashida
							</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>Super Mario 3D Land</i>
							was a logical direction to take in the mainline
							Mario series, with Nintendo almost certainly stuffed
							to the brim with 3D Mario ideas to tinker with after
							the obstacle course structure of Galaxy 2.
							<i>3D Land</i>
							very much feels like a laboratory of Cool Mario Shit
							thrown in a blender, with lots of nods to Nintendo
							games and characters of old. Level geometry is kept
							abstract and purposefully designed to jump on, the
							music is jazzy and bouncy, and the movement is
							simplified to keep the challenges contained in
							scope. Some have criticized this stylistic change as
							rounding too many corners for the series, losing
							some charming complexity of previous entries, and I
							do empathize with those positions, but
							<i>3D Land</i>
							taken on its own merits is a tightly designed
							platformer that pulls its own weight.
						</p>
						<p>
							Structurally, the game strongly resembles
							<i>Galaxy 2</i>
							, both having a linear set of levels to complete
							that emphasize variety, giving a frenetic pace to
							progression and keeping things interesting. However,
							while the
							<i>Galaxy</i>
							games keep you in the same world for a set of
							disjoint challenges,
							<i>3D Land</i>
							is content with a single run through any given
							level, making it feel like a bit like
							<i>Galaxy 2</i>
							with a turbo button. The levels themselves are more
							akin to the recent 2D Mario games, with Star Coins,
							time limits, and a flag pole to conclude. They're
							also quite short, with usually just one or two core
							mechanical motifs consistently implemented
							throughout.
						</p>
						<p>
							In sync with the game's theming, a majority of these
							mechanics are re-implemented from Mario's past:
							<i>Lost Levels</i>
							' poison mushrooms, airship stages from
							<i>SMB3</i>
							,
							<i>Sunshine</i>
							's tightropes, and
							<i>Galaxy</i>
							's jump-flipping platforms are all present here,
							repackaged to suit smaller, denser stages. This
							rapid introduction of mechanics and obstacles works
							to expand the player's platforming vocabulary,
							increasing confidence when the obstacles return in
							more difficult constructions. It comes together
							well, and even in higher-difficulty stages the
							complexity remains manageable. Nothing is ever
							"unfair" from a design standpoint.
						</p>
						<figure class="dotted-line-above">
							<img src="../../img/games/saw-20/3d-land.jpg" />
							<figcaption>
								these spinning spike rods are much more
								terrifying when they come out toward you in 3D.
							</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							The short length of the stages fits the handheld
							medium, but I found myself halfway through World 3
							in a little over an hour during my first session
							with 50-odd lives accumulated. I worried about the
							game's short projected length, but to my surprise,
							finishing the main game unlocks 8 more Special
							worlds to complete. The difficulty is higher on
							average here, with a few tweaks that create much
							more punishing challenges, the most common of which
							are the lack of checkpoints and occasionally even
							power-ups of any kind. Many stages also contain one
							or both of 2 new twists - a 30 second time limit
							that forces riskier play, and a Cosmic Mario-esque
							chase where you can't retrace your steps or risk
							getting hit by a ghost mirroring your actions. When
							these are paired up with the more difficult base
							mechanics in World Special 8,
							<i>3D Land</i>
							gets refreshingly hard for an official Mario title.
						</p>
						<p>
							3D Land falls short in a couple of areas, some of
							which I think were avoidable and others that
							weren't. The elephant in the room here is that it's
							a portable game, arbitrarily condensing stage
							lengths for the sake of the mythical traveling gamer
							who never has more than 5 minutes of free time. The
							3DS directional pad, while serviceable, is nowhere
							near as sensitive or responsive as the analog sticks
							on the 64/GameCube/Wii nunchuk, and the dead zones
							will lead to some dropped directional inputs. The
							problem is exacerbated by the typically fantastic
							implementation of the 3D effect - although it is
							immensely helpful in discerning jump distances,
							Nintendo was so confident in its implementation that
							the camera is completely uncontrollable by the
							player, creating more opportunities for the
							thumbstick to fail you. Hardware limitations are a
							difficult thing to assign blame for, but the problem
							does exist and does hamper the experience, which is
							unfortunate.
						</p>
						<p>
							The difficulty curve was also not well-considered,
							with the first 5 or so worlds basically not ramping
							up at all, and the Special Worlds containing odd
							spikes here and there. On more than one occasion I
							would get my ass beat by a stage and beat the next
							one without breaking a sweat. Maybe these little
							reprieves are psychologically important or something
							but I prefer a more linear progression. Finally, I
							found the game overall to rely
							<i>very</i>
							heavily on auto-scrolling stages, with most in the
							final (and most difficult) levels in a world. They
							make dying extremely punishing, sometimes taking
							full minutes to return to the place where you last
							failed. While some of the ideas are memorable, like
							a bullet hell section on the 8-7 rollercoaster ride,
							replaying lengthier sections was never engaging for
							me, and these are the places where I put the game
							down more often.
						</p>
						<p>
							It's hard for me to come down too hard on
							<i>3D Land</i>
							here as I did genuinely have a super fun time
							beating it. Its length to 100% was perfect (around
							9-10 hours for 75ish stages), there was real
							challenge to be found, and the nonstop variety of
							the stages and their short length makes it quite
							appetizing to "play just one more." I know 3DSes
							aren't exactly high-demand items anymore, but I feel
							like this is worth picking up if you're like me and
							missed it on its release. It's a very worthy entry
							in a legendary series, despite its limitations.
						</p>
						<p class="right-subtext">April 2020, 3DS</p>
						<h2 id="subtitle">Anodyne (2013) - ★★☆☆</h2>
						<p id="subtitle">
							<i>
								dev. Analgesic, dir. Melos Han-Tani & Marina
								Kittaka
							</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>Anodyne</i>
							is an odd game, taking aesthetic, mechanical and
							structural cues from the GBC-era
							<i>Zelda</i>
							titles, but wrapping it in a very strange atmosphere
							of surrealist landscapes, moments of unease and
							horror, and a dark mysticism that can be likened to
							<i>Yume Nikki</i>
							and the more otherworldly stages in the
							<i>Mother</i>
							series. It's a respectable set of influences to draw
							from, and a lot of its value as an experience comes
							from these roots - but the severe lack of polish and
							over-reliance on cheeky parody and meta-commentary
							drag it down into the "rough gem" category for me.
						</p>
						<p>
							The theme of the game is exploration, where the
							protagonist Young and his trusty broom have to
							explore The Land in search of keys and cards that
							will open the path to the mysterious Briar's domain,
							whom you must save. Along the way you'll explore
							mazes, fight some enemies by way of top-down
							<i>Zelda</i>
							, and explore gridset mazes and dungeons. I
							particularly like the variety in scenery - The Land
							itself works as a hubworld that feels convincingly
							material, with forests and a beach and a lake and
							some small houses throughout. As the player delves
							further in anyone direction, and away from this hub,
							the locales get progressively more ethereal and
							incomprehensible.
						</p>
						<p>
							There's a cheery black-and-white town a la
							Tranquility Lane where the music stops almost
							entirely and you're chased by shadow people, a
							smoggy red alien world with giant bipedal walkers
							roaming the landscape, a shady circus with anecdotes
							of all of the freak accidents that happened during
							training with the trapezes and animals, a haunted
							apartment complex with Ghostbusters and
							cockroaches... it all adds up to a consistently
							engaging, off-kilter experience traversing the world
							and making progress. The music is also consistently
							excellent, with some fun chiptunes sprinkled in a
							stew of dark ambient soundscapes and unsettling pad
							synths. The soundtrack consistently elevated the
							experience for me in just about every area there was
							to explore.
						</p>
						<figure class="dotted-line-above">
							<img src="../../img/games/saw-20/lobster.jpg" />
							<figcaption>
								this lobster guy's name was Gerald or something.
							</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							The lack of continuity or really any connection to
							the overarching plot is what kills the mood with
							this aesthetic variety, though. Non-euclidean or
							unexplainable worlds are fine, I actually quite like
							them, but having basically no relevance beyond being
							cool setpieces is slightly annoying. In that way,
							you could reasonably frame
							<i>Anodyne</i>
							's strange tone and pacing as an excuse to string
							together ideas that normally wouldn't work if the
							game took itself seriously at all. There is also a
							smattering of dialogue that is simply there to crack
							jokes at the expense of the game itself, for leaning
							into cliched dialogue or as references to other
							games. I strongly feel that these moments hurt the
							overall experience, as they felt like an admission
							of sorts that the game did not have a strong enough
							identity to stand on its own merits.
						</p>
						<p>
							The rest of the NPCs speak more philosophically,
							with many monologues working more as prose, and
							unforunately no major theme stringing them together
							beyond some motifs of isolation and loneliness.
							However, in both of these scenarios, the narrative
							at hand takes a backseat. Having freshly completed
							the game hours ago I remember these scripted moments
							of dialogue much more than the actual storyline, for
							better and for worse. In a more focused project,
							there's a some potential here for something
							interesting, and I hope Analgesic can get to the
							heart of it.
						</p>
						<p>
							I also need to talk about the technical limitations
							- it may have been the Switch port I played, but the
							game ran incredibly poorly, with dropped frames in
							areas with high sprite counts, slowdown on pause,
							and glitchy AI getting stuck on tiles and even
							clipping out of bounds. Young also controls on the
							slipperier side, and the platforming sections tend
							not to care about how erratically the protagonist
							moves. The combat also feels awful because of the
							lack of enemy pushback, meaning that for enemies
							with set movement patterns, hitting them never
							deters their path unless it's a killing blow. The
							GBC
							<i>Zelda</i>
							games that
							<i>Anodyne</i>
							takes influence from unanimously had this feature,
							because without it, battles are less like a physical
							swordfight and more like swiping at balls of gas.
							This was hardly an issue for most of the game thanks
							to generous and frequent max healthy upgrades, but
							the final bit of the base game is brutally difficult
							because of some enemy spam gauntlets where this
							pushback is not present.
						</p>
						<p>
							After completing the main game, you unlock the
							ability to swap tiles everywhere in main world,
							encouraging you to boundary break and find
							additional secrets. This sort of incentivized
							out-of-bounds stuff is really interesting (you can
							even navigate to your own sprite sheet, basically
							breaking the game), but the interface for navigation
							is so clunky and tedious that after a couple of
							objects found I wasn't very interested in
							continuing. Still, a unique extra diversion that
							apparently returns in the sequel.
						</p>
						<p>
							Despite my complaints with
							<i>Anodyne</i>
							, I'd be hardpressed to say I outright disliked it.
							There is a distinct lack of polish or focus
							throughout but what is there is certainly worthy of
							discussion in both what is succeeded and failed to
							communicate. The pieces are in place to build on
							this foundation, but it needs to shed its
							self-pitying tone and reach for something greater,
							past the cues of its influences. Its sequel,
							<i>Anodyne 2: Return to Dust</i>
							, has been garnering something of a cult following,
							so I hope to see how Analgesic builds on this going
							forward.

						<p>
							<i>Jak and Daxter</i>
							is a game whose legacy is intertwined with both that
							of its creators and their peers, one-third of the
							great factional split between PS2 owners: Jak,
							Ratchet, or Sly? Of the three,
							<i>Jak</i>
							is the series with the least coherent identity,
							having abandoned its foundation to compete with the
							raunchier, more violent third-person shooters that
							were entering the home console zeitgeist. If you'd
							grown up with the later games in the series, you
							might find it hard to believe the original entry in
							the series was Naughty Dog's lighthearted love
							letter to the collect-a-thon platformers of the
							previous generation, and overall uninterested in
							violent power fantasies or GTA-style mission hubs.
						</p>
						<p>
							The premise of
							<i>Jak 1</i>
							is to embark on a dangerous quest through your home
							island to find Gol, a corrupted sage who is plotting
							the destruction of the world. Along the way, you'll
							collect power cells to continue the quest past more
							dangerous obstacles by doing a variety of usual
							platforming things - climbing stuff, completing
							obstacle courses, and the occasional oddjob. Jak's
							movement is punchy and smooth, with jumps and
							attacks weaving into each other in fun ways. The
							aerial attack, a downward ground-pound, actually
							bounces Jak into the air which can be used to pull
							off higher jumps. The "long jump" has a small
							rolling build-up making it more situational than in,
							say,
							<i>Mario 64</i>
							, but as a tradeoff it also doubles as an attack.
							The O-button attack, a
							<i>Crash</i>
							-style spin used for crowd control, can be used in
							the air to slow your descent and slightly increase
							horizontal distance.
						</p>
						<p>
							In some of the more intense gauntlets, you'll be
							jumping and punching in strict rhythms under some
							time constraint, and the controls are definitely
							responsive enough to make these challenging without
							frustration. My one major control gripe is that Jak
							can only add a second jump to his leap if X is
							tapped again before he begins his descent, which is
							earlier on than one might anticipate and goes
							against more conventional "gamer logic" wherein the
							delay between the two jumps is maximized as a safety
							mechanism and correctional tool. You'll have to be a
							bit more careful and precise with Jak than many
							other platformer characters.
						</p>
						<p>
							The major levels are seamlessly woven into the
							hubworld, with no loading screens at all, giving the
							world a sense of physical plausibility and cohesion
							- if you believe Guinness's Book of World Records,
							its the first of its kind. Every stage physically
							lies in the area that you'd imagine they do given
							their entrances, and you can even see landmarks from
							other areas if you can find the right vantage point.
							It's really incredible and the logical next-gen
							progression of the
							<i>Banjo-Kazooie</i>
							framework. The grounded setting is also a bit of a
							content downfall, though. It is difficult to create
							a platformer in a semi-realistic physical space
							(especially one in a tropical setting) that doesn't
							seep into some of gaming's oldest level theme
							cliches. Outside of an ancient, Atlantean-inspired
							underwater city, the theming is standard affair.
						</p>
						<figure class="dotted-line-above">
							<img src="../../img/games/saw-20/jak.webp" />
							<figcaption>
								the vibes here are impeccable, though.
							</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							The stages themselves are incredibly designed,
							however, with all of the power cells and collectible
							orbs available at all times. A heavy emphasis on
							loops and circular design lands the player back in
							familiar territory after platforming gauntlets and
							more linear paths. There's almost no backtracking to
							speak of, and doing a clean sweep of a level in one
							go is satisfying. The variety of challenges is also
							consistently high, with some instant classics like
							knocking a power cell out of a giant bird's stomach
							and racing it to the landing spot, or punching cows
							back into a stable, or ascending an underground
							construction site of an ancient mech. While not all
							cells are major setpieces, they are logically placed
							and rewarding to find.
						</p>
						<p>
							Like many games in the genre, there are a series of
							minigame cells that are of variable quality. Some
							are collected in vehicle-only sections on your
							trusty Zoomer, all of which I have no problems with
							because the thing controls like a dream, with sharp
							cornering and a reasonable top speed - most
							importantly, the game never asks too much from the
							player in these areas, as it's not the focus.
							However, a few cells are completed while atop the
							child of the giant bird mentioned previously, and
							its slippery control scheme was just different
							enough from the base controls to feel frustrating to
							reign in. Finally, there are two different one-off
							minigames that are completely out of place - a fish
							collecting game with twitchy controls and a defense
							shooter in first-person that lies about its
							instructions in its introductory cutscene. Even as
							optional content, they are fairly unwelcome.
						</p>
						<p>
							Even with some quality peaks and valleys,
							<i>Jak 1</i>
							is a well-thought out game with many decisions made
							to bring the collect-a-thon framework into the 6th
							generation of consoles. The cohesive world and
							lighthearted tone lend itself well to a sense of
							adventure, and the outstanding level design keeps
							progress fast and satisfying. It's one of the few
							games I'd say a majority of people 100% just because
							it's so accessible and fast-paced in its structure.
							Minor grievances aside, this is a highly-replayable
							landmark title for the genre and one of the very
							best of its ilk in the 6th generation. To this day,
							Naughty Dog's gritty, trope-riddled reboot of the
							series in the later entries is one of the more
							disappointing directions a series has ever taken.

							WarioWare: Smooth Moves (2006) - ★★½✩
						</h2>
						<p id="subtitle">
							<i>
								dev. Intelligent Systems, dir. Goro Abe & Taku
								Sugioka
							</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>Smooth Moves</i>
							is a worthwhile entry in the
							<i>WarioWare</i>
							series, and like its predecessors is a game about
							using quick reflexes and information processing
							skills to play tiny microgames in quick succession,
							identifying what must be done to win and then
							executing within 5-10 seconds. The formula is
							rock-solid and pretty airtight, and the creativity
							on display here is pretty amazing, but the extensive
							use of unreliable motion controls puts a slight
							damper on the experience.
						</p>
						<p>
							Being a very early title for the Wii, a big emphasis
							was put on the utilization of the Wiimote to create
							gameplay that was not possible on other systems. The
							result of that is around a dozen different "stances"
							for the controller that the player must learn for
							different sets of microgames. For example, you might
							hold the Wiimote like a pencil to draw something, or
							like a broomhandle to sweep something. The stance
							required for the next microgame is flashed on the
							screen right before it starts, which may seem to
							blunt the series' unpredictability, but many of the
							stances that seem obvious or limited are switched up
							in very clever ways. In conjunction with the vast
							ocean of possibilities for a motion control scheme,
							you'll be pushed into pretty chaotic territory even
							knowing which stance to use, which is great.
						</p>
						<figure class="dotted-line-above">
							<img src="../../img/games/saw-20/warioware.webp" />
							<figcaption>
								bonus points for actually doing slapstick comedy
								right.
							</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							The crucial issue with the game is unfortunately
							something that pervaded most all of the earliest Wii
							titles: inconsistency with certain setups and
							motions that can lead to a feeling of struggling
							through certain microgames. A handful of the games
							just never controlled well for me or my friends and
							were considered to be "automatic losses," which
							really sucks. Additionally, the cutesy and concise
							instructions for the game tend to fail the player
							more often in
							<i>Smooth Moves</i>
							, as the actual motion meant to be done is not
							obvious, even given the stance.
						</p>
						<p>
							An example that comes to mind is a game in the
							"Remote" stance, just neutrally pointing the Wiimote
							at the sensor bar, where you control a hole in the
							ground and need to ensnare some people running
							around a room. The actual motion to move the hole is
							not clear by the instruction to "Trap!" - am I meant
							to point it like a flashlight, or move the remote
							toward and away from the screen to simulate
							physically being in the room, or tilt the remote
							right and left to "steer" it? Worse still is the
							fact that these motions are easily conflated with
							one another, so you may not understand how a game
							truly works even after completing it correctly. This
							sort of obscurity is not present in the much tighter
							handheld entries and it dulls the experience
							whenever it occurs.
						</p>
						<p>
							While these problems in conjunction severely cap the
							experience overall in terms of a consistent gameplay
							experience, I do want to express again how
							interesting of a game this is design-wise, with
							functions of the Wii remote never seen since. The
							psychology of the microgames was grounded in
							quasi-reality, giving the player an easy way to
							understand the new controller by relating their
							movements to things that they already do and have
							done. Naming the stances after real-life use cases
							for those bodily motions was also a stroke of genius
							that immediately contextualizes the stance and its
							possibilities. In addition to some genuinely funny
							writing and some laugh-out-loud ridiculous games,
							the overall experience is hard to fault in its
							ambition. For that, I still consider it to be worth
							playing and experiencing for yourself.

						<h2 id="subtitle">Mario Power Tennis (2004) - ★★★☆</h2>
						<p id="subtitle">
							<i>dev. Camelot, dir. Haruki Kodera</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>Mario Power Tennis</i>
							is a genuinely fun arcade tennis experience, and the
							crown jewel of the robust collection of GameCube-era
							Mario sports titles. In addition to characters from
							the series with wildly differing attributes that
							encourage varying styles of play, there are enough
							arcade-y gimmick twists on the formula to keep the
							game fresh, whether you're playing by yourself or
							with others.
						</p>
						<p>
							The actual game of tennis, all gimmicks aside and
							turned off, is very solid. You can play either
							singles or double with 1-4 players, and the control
							scheme is very simple and easy to pick up. Novices
							can play a decent game with just the left stick and
							normal topspins via the A button, while more
							experienced players can take advantage of slices
							with B, lobs with A->B, and drop shots with B->A,
							and smashes with A+B. The moveset is small, but
							mastering the time and place for each of these
							swings will take some effort.
						</p>
						<p>
							To boot, there are a handful of different types of
							characters with different strengths on offense and
							defense. Power characters have strong smashes and
							great spiking ability but lack mobility in the
							backcourt. Speed characters are mostly the opposite,
							with great defensive mobility and poor hitting
							power. Tricky characters have massive curves on
							their hits but relatively low stats otherwise,
							making them a bit gimmicky but powerful in the right
							hands. Defense characters have long reaches that
							make up for their slower movement speeds, and make
							great backline doubles partners. Finally, Technical
							characters specialize in strong angles which can be
							difficult to volley. Mario & Luigi, of course,
							provide all-around characters to get your bearings
							before you find your playstyle.
						</p>
						<figure class="dotted-line-above">
							<img src="../../img/games/saw-20/shyguy.gif" />
							<figcaption>
								the game also has a surprising amount of cursed
								Mario lore.
							</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							The major addition
							<i>Mario Power Tennis</i>
							brings to the base formula comes by way of the
							offensive and defensive Power Shots, which either
							help the player reach a ball they couldn't get to or
							increase the power of one they're about to the
							volley. The largest issue with the Power Shots is
							the animation time - although only comprising a few
							seconds each they completely halt the action, and
							are earned after only a handful of successful normal
							volleys. In doubles settings, 4 players using their
							Power Shots in succession can feel chaotic as much
							as it is tedious. Many of them are pretty creative,
							although some are certainly better and useful in
							more situations than others.
						</p>
						<p>
							For example, Daisy's defensive Power Shot has her
							diving towards the ball, physically moving her to a
							likely far-from-center position that can be easily
							exploited on the returning volley. Alternatively,
							Peach's defensive Power Shot brings the ball back
							within her reach, not changing her position, which
							improves her ability to get back into the action
							without consequences. There are various little
							quirks like that which arise as you experiment with
							different characters, and in combination with the
							character's type and strengths/weaknesses you'll
							start to see a bit of a hierarchy form. That said,
							none of these advantages are such that equally
							skilled players would ever consitently lose given
							certain matchups. The overall balance is interesting
							and depending on the opponent you'll quickly surmise
							what strategies would work best to gain the upper
							hand, which is great fun, especially in multiplayer
							where psychological effects are in play as well.
						</p>
						<p>
							In addition to the regular exhibition mode, there is
							a series of tournaments to play in both singles and
							doubles mode, with each successive victory unlocking
							new characters, courts, modes, and minigames - all
							of which have a great amount of variety. A huge,
							avoidable misstep here is that the doubles
							tournaments are still single-player only, requiring
							the use of a very unreliable COM partner, which can
							feel a little frustrating depending on your choice
							of character. The matches get progressively longer
							in number of sets as the opponent difficulty is
							raised, making for a nice challenge. Finally, there
							are some minigames that can help improve your skills
							in both single-player and multiplayer settings,
							though they are fairly limited in their scope
							outside of one very clever twist on
							<i>Mario Paint</i>
							, where you volley globs of paint into a picture
							until it's colored correctly. They are a fun
							distraction and there are a lot of them but they're
							a tiny bit half-baked: a
							<i>Mario Party</i>
							-style take on the training exercises from
							<i>Virtua Tennis 2</i>
							.
						</p>
						<p>
							Finally, the courts occasionally have gimmicks to
							them as well, usually with concepts re-used from
							other successful Mario-adjacent GameCube titles. I
							really like the collective look and feel of this
							Nintendo era, and this sort of continuity is
							creative and feels fresh. There's a
							<i>Luigi's Mansion</i>
							court with ghosts that can block your movement,
							three
							<i>Super Mario Sunshine</i>
							courts with sludge on the ground, moving court
							bounds, and a tilting hanging court, respectively, a
							<i>Donkey Kong: Jungle Beat</i>
							court with snappers that impede your movement, a
							<i>WarioWare</i>
							court made of conveyor belts, and a classic
							<i>Mario Bros.</i>
							-inspired court with enemies from the original
							arcade game. The coolest part about these courts is
							that the effects are always triggered by the match
							participants, and can be used to gain an upper hand.
							Similarly, if burdened by the gimmick of the stage,
							the "reset" buttons for the gimmick in question also
							lie on the stage and can either be walked over or
							hit on the opponent's side of the court, giving the
							player the power to manipulate the court in real
							time. It's frantic and absolutely insane, and
							definitely where the ingenuity of the formula comes
							to life the most.
						</p>
						<p>
							In all,
							<i>Mario Power Tennis</i>
							is a pretty outstanding arcade tennis game with some
							great character quirks and balancing, inspired court
							design, some interesting twists on the normal tennis
							gameplay, and fun diversions that make it hard to
							put down. It isn't perfect - doubles can be chaotic
							and a little frustrating, some matchups seem
							downright unwinnable, and outside of the tourneys
							there's not an enormous amount of content to dig
							into. The minigames in particular could have been
							more fun in single-player if they had a larger
							emphasis on improving the player instead of making a
							fun party game. In all, though, you'll be
							hard-pressed to find a better-designed sports game
							on the GameCube, and maybe in the entire 6th
							generation of consoles.

						<h2 id="subtitle">Advance Wars (2001) - ★★½✩</h2>
						<p id="subtitle">
							<i>dev. Intelligent Systems, dir. Toru Narihiro</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							While the bright presentation and expressive
							characters might convince you that it's built for
							kids,
							<i>Advance Wars</i>
							is a disarmingly punishing turn-based tactics game
							with a very strong, if simple mechanical foundation.
							Strategy games are my final game genre frontier and
							as such I have very little applicable experience to
							draw from, but even to my amateurish eyes this is a
							game that, while neatly presented, can feel
							haphazardly assembled.
						</p>
						<p>
							The core gameplay of
							<i>Advance Wars</i>
							(and presumably the previous
							<i>Wars</i>
							titles) revolves around moving your units around a
							plausibly realistic area of terrain to defeat an
							enemy militia by either wiping out every unit or
							capturing their home base. The maps tend to have
							rivers, mountains, roads, and bridges that create
							chokepoints, directional lanes of attack, and
							generally draw your attention or encourage a
							particular playstyle. The armies are made up of the
							mobile but weak foot soldiers who can capture bases,
							and various vehicular units in the ground, sea, and
							sky.
						</p>
						<p>
							There are a lot of different types, usually one for
							every matchup you can imagine - bomber planes that
							can attack ground units but not other flying ones,
							long-range artillery units that can attack without
							returning fire but can't move and shoot the same
							turn, transport-only units to quickly move infantry,
							battleships for aerial units to dock and refuel, and
							so on. There's a lot to keep track of but nothing
							stands out as massively complicated, and in general
							it feels like the distillation of an imaginary
							war-by-paper. No units are especially creative or
							unique, it's all based on real-world war imagery and
							pretty much as standard as you could imagine such a
							title.
						</p>
						<p>
							The units' interactions are compounded by the CO
							system, wherein the commanding officer that you pick
							for your mission will alter their squad's abilities
							and stats, increasing range or mobility or firepower
							at the expense of another. Additionally, each CO has
							a special power they can activate after a certain
							amount of in-match progress that they can use to
							increase their advantages even further and make a
							decisive strike. The catch here is that you will
							always being facing an opposing CO as well, so being
							wary of the enemy's strengths is just as important
							as maximizing your own. If you aren't careful you
							can have your entire squad taken behind the shed in
							just a couple of unfortunate turns.
						</p>
						<figure>
							<img
								src="../../img/games/saw-20/advance-wars-units.webp"
								alt=""
							/>
							<figcaption>
								I love the color schemes on these units. uh,
								reminds me something.
							</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							The weakest part of
							<i>Advance Wars</i>
							' combat design is the indecision surrounding the
							factories. Some of the maps have factory tiles that,
							when captured, can produce units with the funds you
							accumulate as you capture more neutral cities and
							outposts, something that I think helps the player
							make more crucial or daring tactical maneuvers: if
							you are able to create more units, the present units
							become more disposable, and you're able to sacrifice
							them to pull off daring backdoor rushes for the
							opposing base or safely complete a retreat.
							Additionally, it adds a layer of managerial depth to
							each turn, as you can assess what units would be
							most helpful to your existing troops and allocate
							resources accordingly.
						</p>
						<p>
							All that is great, but a large amount of the maps
							don't have these factories at all, which is awkward.
							Not only do you endlessly accumulate funds that you
							can't use, but the value of capturing cities is
							dropped significantly without their money generating
							function, and in turn that weakens the utility of
							the foot soldier units who are the only ones capable
							of capturing a city to begin with. It really feels
							like at one point the game would revolve around
							these factories, but they couldn't commit to them in
							every map as it raised the complexity too much for a
							game that's trying to be a bit simpler to pick up.
							As it stands, this whole implementation can
							occasionally feel awkward, but it's more of a steady
							annoyance than a game-breaking oversight.
						</p>
						<p>
							Interestingly, the game doesn't allow you to
							actually dig into the meat of the content - the
							Campaign and War Room modes - until you complete a
							very rigorous and well-considered Training mode,
							consisting of 14 tutorials to teach you about the
							basics of the combat and how different units
							interact. The complexity of the challenges is raised
							throughout the missions as less guidance is given,
							perfectly easing the player into the early missions
							in the campaign mode. While locking off the content
							is a controversial decision, I think it was for the
							better, as there are a shit-ton of unit types in
							this game, and learning them in the actual campaign
							missions themselves may have been a bit overbearing.
						</p>
						<p>
							The campaign is a cheeky romp through various
							countries where your group of COs are ordered to
							chase down the Blue Star commander Olaf. Across your
							travels you'll pick fights with just about every
							nation on earth, all of whom marvel at each others'
							power like some kind of shounen. It's a bit weird,
							and it begs some questions that probably aren't
							meant to be asked, like who's calling the shots on
							this mission? Why aren't precautions being taken to
							avoid unnecessary conflict? Why do the resources and
							unit support fluctuate so wildly for your team, who
							appear to be the squadron taking on the most
							pressing and important mission for your country at
							all times? Most of the storyline is just an excuse
							to run into certain COs of varying skillsets and
							temperaments and blast them all to smithereens, and
							the relationships between the COs are cliched. It's
							quaint, and it has its charms with the colorful
							presentation, but it's a bit lacking overall.
							Fundamentally, it just never produces a compelling
							reason to keep playing the game beyond just wanting
							a tactics game to play.
						</p>
						<figure>
							<img
								src="../../img/games/saw-20/advancewars.gif"
								alt=""
							/>
							<figcaption>
								I know those guys just got totally obliterated
								but it's so cute.
							</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							You have three COs under your command for a majority
							of the campaign, but they were certainly not created
							equal. Some of the characters are just completely
							outmatched in certain levels, but the general
							strategy reveals itself simply by looking at the
							terrain, which you can't see until you start the
							mission. Not being able to see a layout of the
							terrain before selecting your CO is really
							frustrating and feels like guesswork at times. Most
							of the missions are designed with a single CO in
							mind, but I really struggled to find a good use for
							Sami, as Andy's defensive bonuses and Max's
							ridiculous firepower gave me everything I needed for
							the entire campaign.
						</p>
						<p>
							After you're done with the campaign, the War Room
							mode gives the game some additional longevity. This
							is something of a challenge course where the player
							has to face some difficult odds on a carefully
							crafted scenario in given terrain and against a
							given CO. You're given a choice of CO, including
							some of the enemies from the campaign if you've
							managed to unlock them. It's a fun diversion and a
							lot of them are really tough, but they do definitely
							sharpen your brain and let you focus a little bit
							more on the easier stuff elsewhere in the game.
							Finally, there's a pretty cool one-console
							multiplayer mode where you can pass the gameboy to a
							friend and play against one another. This is really
							fun but unfortunately, unless both of you are quite
							good at the game, the AI COs probably act more
							optimally and are tougher as a result.
						</p>
						<p>
							In all,
							<i>Advance Wars</i>
							is a charming and entertaining pure tactics game
							that was still trying to find its footing. The
							game's polish and quality varies a lot, with a
							strange and ultimately inconsequential storyline in
							the campaign mode, a very thorough and detailed
							tutorial, and fun basic unit combat held back
							slightly by the awkward resources system. I do think
							in general this is certainly worth a play, if you
							fancy yourself smart enough to figure out how to
							outthink some of the more punishing levels and
							scenarios. The CO powers bring some interesting
							dynamics to the experience and for a handheld title
							this is among the decent non-RPG offerings in the
							genre. Worth a try, with some conditions.

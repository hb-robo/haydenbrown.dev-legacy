							<i>Spec Ops: The Line</i>
							is a game with a complicated legacy, especially for
							those who were not around or paying attention during
							its initial release. Yager's vision was a timely
							commentary and critique of the military shooter
							genre that had become wildly popular ever since the
							release of
							<i>Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</i>
							in 2007. The existence of interactive stories about
							real-life military conflicts is not something we
							have grappled with as a society in 2020, and it
							certainly hadn't in 2012.
						</p>
						<p>
							The first-person shooter is inseparable from
							real-world war. From 1999-2010 there were 3-5 FPS
							games about World War II released every year, with
							setpieces that matched or were inspired by real life
							events. Making a game about a modern setting, such
							as the Gulf Wars or the "War on Terror" post-9/11,
							is much more challenging because it's both too
							recent for the full public to get a handle on the
							seriousness of, and far more insidious than the US
							government would like you to believe. There is no
							draft, it takes place in a far-away place, and the
							"bad guys" have a totally different culture and way
							of life - it's a perfectly docile war that does not
							linger much in the back of the average American's
							mind.
						</p>
						<p>
							So what's the challenge with portraying these wars
							in a game, then? For one, truth and accuracy are
							completely out of the question, because a lot of the
							details of certain battles and engagements won't be
							declassified for a long time. But even things we do
							know about are recklessly and blatantly distorted to
							obfuscate the United States' involvement. Take
							2019's
							<i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</i>
							(believe it or not, an entirely different game than
							the one mentioned before), which blamed the
							real-life American-led bombings and killings on the
							"Highway of Death" outside of Kuwait as a Russian
							act of terror that the good guy Americans were
							acting on to stop.
						</p>
						<p>
							This type of historical revision goes deeper than
							than details - even things like playing
							adrenaline-pumping music and altering the tone of
							these engagements as "fair" or morally sound also
							counts as foul play. Even more disgusting than the
							historical misrepresentation, though, is that this
							was the first wave of games, ever, to desensitize
							the world to violence that was still being actively
							perpetuated.
						</p>
						<figure>
							<img
								src="../../img/games/spec-ops/highway-of-death.jpg"
							/>
							<figcaption>
								never, ever let them get away with this garbage.
							</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							In WW2 shooters, the player can feel eventually
							desensitized to the violence they are committing
							against the Nazis, and this generally is not
							approached with much scrutiny. They were bound
							together by ideals of ethnic cleansing, genocide,
							and rampant imperialism - by nearly every Western
							account, they were the enemy of the world.
							Crucially, we as a society had enough time to digest
							the fallout of WW2 over the last 70 years to arrive
							at that conclusion. It may have always been obvious
							to many or most, but that framing has persisted from
							generation to generation, creating a mutually
							acknowledged context that artists are willing to
							explore. It's a colloquial truth that if you see the
							swastika in a film, the men bearing it are intended
							to be villains.
						</p>
						<p>
							How does one extrapolate that to an ongoing
							conflict, especially one as asymmetric as the
							current War on Terror the US perpetuates in the
							Middle East? Who will history see as the aggressor,
							the victor, the side deserving of sympathy? This
							gets at the heart of the dangers of modern military
							games - they actively create false pretenses by way
							of boots-on-the-ground perspectives, historical
							revisionism, and gamifying the murders of Middle
							Eastern folks of all creeds and cultures, all while
							the real life equivalent is happening
							simultaneously.
						</p>
						<p>
							Taking into account that American schools
							purposefully do not explain much about modern
							history in grade school or even in high school, for
							some kids, these games might be the only serious
							media representation of the War on Terror that they
							experience, severely damaging their understanding of
							a conflict predicated on unjustifiable imperialist
							bullshit. This exact media climate is the
							fundamental justification for
							<i>Spec Ops: The Line</i>
							's existence: to reintroduce the lost context of
							what it means to be at war.
						</p>
						<figure>
							<img
								src="../../img/games/spec-ops/army-esports.jpg"

							<figcaption>
								and there's
								<i>definitely</i>
								no incentive for the US to have stupid gamers.
								none at all.
							</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							In a confrontational twist, the realization that
							this game was going to be unpleasant and give the
							player the promised super-soldier power fantasy was
							meant to be a surprise, the game masquerading as the
							typical garbage until an hour or two in. That
							deconstructionist switch caused a massive spike in
							critical reception, with some reviewers calling it
							gaming's answer to "Heart of Darkness."
						</p>
						<p>
							In the current lens of the game's digital life
							cycle, where it's regularly sold for under $5 and
							thrown into dozens of different bundles for the
							cheap, this bait and switch premise is
							<i>by far</i>
							the most widely-known thing about it, which dulls
							the impact quite a bit in retrospect. In that
							respect, it's more like gaming's
							<i>Sixth Sense</i>
							- the novelty of the experience is lost almost
							immediately after release, giving it two separate
							audiences.
						</p>
						<p>
							Additionally, some of the approaches to Spec Ops'
							philosophy are a bit heavy-handed. The infamous
							quotes of peace and historical wisdom displayed upon
							the player's death in the Call of Duty series are
							replaced with direct attacks on the player's moral
							fiber.
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>
								"To kill for yourself is murder. To kill for
								your government is heroic. To kill for
								entertainment is harmless."
							</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>
								"The US military usually does not condone the
								killing of unarmed combatants. But this isn't
								real, so why should you care?"
							</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>
								"Cognitive dissonance is an uncomfortable
								feeling caused by holding two conflicting ideas
								simultaneously."
							</i>
						</p>
						<p><i>"Do you feel like a hero yet?"</i></p>
						<figure>
							<img
								src="../../img/games/spec-ops/loading-screen.jpg"
							/>
							<figcaption>
								any player-as-soldier should be asked this
								question. it's a "no" surprisingly often.
							</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							This approach leaves a sour taste in the mouths of
							the "second audience," who embrace the game's
							critique on the genre, who sought out the game
							specifically to experience how one would begin to
							deconstruct the modern shooter. Many players agree
							with the premise and identify similar ethical
							problems in the gaming industry, but Yager was
							primarily concerned with infiltrating the library of
							the "first audience" to confront them with the
							reality of their actions. Framing the player as the
							antagonist is appropriate in that context - if a bit
							risky considering they just paid $60 for the game -
							but these days it's rarely approached with that
							perspective in earnest, and now played mostly by
							those that wish to judge the effectiveness and
							clarity of its critique.
						</p>
						<p>
							By nature, the second audience must experience the
							game too, and be put in positions where their
							ideologies are confronted and questioned, even if
							they do not hold the subconscious beliefs of the
							original intended audience. This sums up to an
							experience and critique that, to put it lightly, has
							not aged particularly well, as its focus was simply
							too narrow. There is a case to be made that Yager
							were going for a hail-mary play that disregarded the
							longevity of the game, considering the generic look
							and branding of the title in an oversaturated
							market, but it holds itself back by not being able
							to detach itself from the context of its release.
						</p>
						<p>
							Gaming also has an inherent bias toward the player
							being able to "solve" the situation they are placed
							in, which has resulted in many clamoring for the
							ability to always do the right thing throughout the
							game, and the lack of such moral options proving
							that it's a weak critique because the player is
							never able to act in a pious or beneficial way.
							Adding these options, though, would be
							catestrophically hypocritical on behalf of the
							developers, who intentionally present the situation
							as it exists in the real-world space it emulates -
							one without any moral clarity or simple, one-man
							fixes. Not only does Spec Ops: The Line take on the
							industry in which is is afforded an existence, but
							also the player for whom it is designed.
						</p>
						<p>
							There is no written contract with gaming that it
							must always serve as morally reaffirming comfort,
							but I do empathize with those who try very hard to
							do the right thing in Spec Ops and are continually
							rejected. This is, in a very distilled way, the
							point: sometimes even the "best" choice available is
							still despicable.
						</p>
						<figure>
							<img src="../../img/games/spec-ops/prisoners.jpg" />
							<figcaption>
								besides, do you think real-world colonizers even
								try to make the "best" choices?
							</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							The final point I'd like to address is that all of
							the atrocities seen and executed by the player in
							Spec Ops: The Line are completely out of
							self-preservation. If the three soldiers you command
							throughout the game were killed in the initial
							confrontation in the outskirts of Dubai, there is
							reason to believe that hundreds if not thousands of
							lives would have been saved. Every fight is
							perpetuated specifically to keep the player alive
							and to make "progress" through the narrative, so if
							you were to give up on making progress, these
							digital lives could be saved, and you'd have less
							blood on your hands. The final choice that the game
							presents you with is to continue playing it.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is a completely unprecedented design choice up
							until the point of Spec Ops' release, and it's a bit
							contentious due to the consumerist nature of the
							industry. "You really want me to just stop playing a
							game I paid money for?" is a question that is
							commonly discussed. However, in contrast to the
							game's slowly deteriorating "gotcha" that has come
							to define its legacy, this choice posed to the
							player ages like a fine wine, becoming increasingly
							more appealing as the price point of entry for the
							game continues to decrease. Eventually, if this game
							were to be released as freeware, its most crucial
							and controversial element may be actualized:
							choosing to walk away becomes an option that is
							untethered to the human instinct to feel a sense of
							ownership over that which our dollars buy.
						</p>
						<p>
							I do think that Spec Ops is a very conceptually
							strong game with good, if unempathetic methods of
							getting those concepts across. Its execution is
							shaky at times, and it resides a lot in the realm of
							satire for its 2012 contemporaries; games are
							increasingly being perceived as isolated
							experiences, and Spec Ops is one of the few that
							truly cannot be detached from the world it was made
							in. It is highly experimental and occasionally
							outright confrontational to the player both as a
							person and a consumer, and as a result is not
							guaranteed to be a pleasant or even comfortable
							experience for many.
						</p>
						<p>
							Very few games warrant such discussion, and to alter
							some of its fundamental design decisions would be to
							undermine the message behind the madness, even if
							that means going against some of the most sacred
							"unwritten rules" of engagement that games have
							historically had with the player. Spec Ops: The Line
							will likely stand the test of time as a game studied
							for both its courage and the controversy it sought
							to create.

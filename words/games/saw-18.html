							Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes (2000) - ★★★✩
						</h2>
						<p id="subtitle">
							<i>dev. CAPCOM, dir. Yoshihiro Sudo</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							As far as arcade mainstays in America go,
							<i>MvC2</i>
							is on Mount Rushmore. Gorgeous spritework, a
							flamboyant lounge-jazz soundtrack, and flashy,
							fast-paced combat system based around teamwork and
							combo-chains made it an immediate eye-catcher for
							many kids growing up around the turn of the century.
							And for good reason, too, because
							<i>MvC2</i>
							is one of the most entertaining fighters I've ever
							played.
						</p>
						<p>
							From top to bottom, the roster is stacked with
							familiar names - half of the
							<i>Street Fighter</i>
							and
							<i>Darkstalkers</i>
							mainstays comprise the CAPCOM corner, while the
							Marvel roster strikes a cool balance of Avengers,
							X-Men, and deep cut cult favorites like Blackheart
							and Omega Red. The Marvel characters steal the show
							here, too - the sprites are large, detailed, fluid,
							and look ripped right out of a comic page. The
							fanservice emphasis is pretty blatant, but this was
							a time well before Marvel became the
							super-conglomerate film factory it is in 2018 - it
							was very clear that the game was an outlet of
							passion for comic books for many artists working at
							CAPCOM in the late 1990s. And what better way to
							celebrate a vast roster of fighters and heroes than
							to embrace a team-based battle system?
						</p>
						<p>
							It's perfectly rational to try and play this like
							<i>Street Fighter</i>
							with three life bars, but the real fun comes from
							using assists, hyper moves, character switching, and
							delay hypers to disorient and stunlock your opponent
							for as long as possible. Because characters provide
							value in both assists and team hypers even when not
							actively being played, the defensive priority is to
							keep everyone alive as long as possible, leading to
							plenty of interesting 1v1 matchups over the course
							of just a single fight. Throw the
							rock-paper-scissors-etc. matchup hierarchy of the
							character archetypes into the mix and you have a
							recipe that encourages experimentation, knowledge of
							the game, raw instinct, and the bold. Narrowing down
							the three characters that you feel most comfortable
							with is extremely rewarding.
						</p>
						<figure class="dotted-line-above">
							<img src="../../img/games/saw-18/mvc2.jpg" />
							<figcaption>
								file this under "pictures you can hear."
							</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							That said, like most high-budget fighters with large
							rosters, the main gameplay issues arise not from
							controls but roster balance. In fact, a quick watch
							of any high-level
							<i>MvC2</i>
							tournament play will tell you that only 10ish of the
							56 heroes in this game are really all that viable
							when you're at the top - which, while indicative of
							some deeper mechanical issues, is really not all
							that important to the 90%+ of players who play
							single player Arcade mode or against friends. I can
							unabashedly tell you I've gotten my ass kicked by
							well over half the roster, so I'd say "viability"
							and tier lists can be a bit of a placebo. At any
							rate, even the absolute worst characters in the game
							can still be used as passable assists, making even
							the largest balance disparities less impactful than
							in other games.
						</p>
						<p>
							As a home port,
							<i>New Age of Heroes</i>
							doesn't do much to flesh the base game out into the
							full experience it could have been. The additions of
							the ever-helpful training mode is always welcome,
							but the only other key differences are a score
							attack mode and the fact that 36/56 of the
							characters have to be unlocked through hours of
							playtime. Attempts at maintaining the feel of the
							original arcade game also means the UI can also come
							off as wonky occasionally - meaning no unselecting
							characters at all, and returning to the main menu
							has to wait until after you've started the fight. I
							personally don't find this very hindering, but
							explaining it to 3 or more people while the game
							boots up is not easy.
						</p>
						<p>
							The quest to unlock all 36 unlockable characters, 7
							bonus stages, and extra costumes for every character
							in the game will probably take weeks. But that's
							just really a tertiary goal to keep you playing one
							of the most varied and tight fighting games on the
							Dreamcast.

							Uncharted: Drake's Fortune (2007) - ★★☆☆
						</h2>
						<p id="subtitle">
							<i>dev. Naughty Dog, dir. Amy Hennig</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							It's hard to believe in 2018, but this game was at
							one point both a ground-breaking tech demo and a
							preview into what game developers believed was the
							future of gaming. I remember being floored at E3
							when the player character actually got wet when he
							walked into a small lagoon. These small details,
							full body mo-cap, and a focus on linear setpieces
							were set to usher in a new era of games that could
							be easily justified as art - we were going to make
							games films, and the easiest first step was to
							create a convincing action flick.
						</p>
						<p>
							In recent years, the gaming industry has pivoted
							away from on-rails, "cinematic" experiences in favor
							of more nuanced, player-driven exploration and
							exposition. While I very much appreciate this
							direction, as I feel like it's brought forth some
							thoughtful game design trends, I think the actual
							cinematic qualities present in games like Uncharted
							are played down as a consequence.
						</p>
						<p>
							The story is predictably silly, and the cast of
							characters draw heavily from tropes of cinema past,
							with predictable behavior and reactions to
							everything in front of them. The gang, led by Sir
							Francis Drake's descendant, Nathan, embarks on a
							quest for the El Dorado, a 500-pound statue of solid
							gold, gradually discovering evidence of an ancient
							curse surrounding the totem - I'll leave it there as
							it actually gets pretty interesting. The player
							makes their way from setpiece to setpiece, where
							they'll be presented with some enemies, a braindead
							puzzle to solve, or some
							<i>Sands of Time</i>
							-esque platforming, but man, the pacing really does
							feel like a late 70s action flick.
						</p>
						<figure class="dotted-line-above">

						</figure>
						<p>
							The areas that you might walk around and take in
							during some dialogue or an environmental puzzle
							usually end up as your cover in a firefight. They're
							never overwhelmingly big, and a myriad of spare
							clips and weapons across the battlefield (and
							enemies pushing up on you in CQC gear) force you to
							move often and thoughtfully. Indecisiveness will
							certainly get you killed, so some fights can
							frustrate until you figure out a solid strategy, but
							they're also over quickly (with generous
							checkpoints) so your time never feels especially
							wasted on death.
						</p>
						<p>
							The game is also kind of arcade-y in structure,
							rewarding headshots, kills with variety of guns, and
							going for "streaks" (50 kills with no deaths, 5
							straight melee kills, etc), and the collection of
							various treasures hidden around the levels. The only
							mode is story mode, so they added a ton of
							replayability factors like weapon select, fast/slow
							motion, and costumes. These things make it easier to
							earn certain rewards, which in turn unlocks you more
							stuff, so if you like the game it's actually fun to
							go back through at least a second time to play
							clean-up. Ultimately though, the game does remind
							you of its insular nature a bit too often (the pause
							menu
							<i>is</i>
							the main menu, for instance), a problem that would
							be fixed in the sequels.
						</p>
						<p>
							All in all, does it encroach on
							<i>Indiana Jones</i>
							and
							<i>Tomb Raider</i>
							territory too much? Absolutely yes, this is straight
							up lifting a ton of material from both and it can be
							grating to hear the two guys go back and forth
							exactly like Indy and his father. But it does have a
							lot of charm, and the game is well-thought out
							enough to give momentum to its story. At its
							absolute worst, the game is merely an
							inconsequential romp through a jungle and ruins, and
							for some that might sound miserable. But action
							movie aficionados and general appreciators of B-reel
							dumb shit will find fun here.

							Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch (2013) - ★½☆☆
						</h2>
						<p id="subtitle">
							<i>dev. Level-5, dir. Ken Motomura</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>Ni no Kuni</i>
							is a game that has been on my radar for a number of
							years now, and I'm happy I finally got around to
							playing and beating it as I zoom through my PS3
							exclusives that I've been putting off. A JPRG
							visually directed by the legendary Studio Ghibli,
							even if just their B-Team, seemed to be a solid
							match for Level-5's recent successes with the
							<i>Dragon Quest</i>
							remakes. But despite this game being an occasionally
							positive experience for me, almost every single
							thing about it is compromised in some way, and
							ultimately feels like something that could've been
							much greater.
						</p>
						<p>
							The primary plot device sees Oliver, a perfectly
							normal young boy from a small Americana town called
							Motorville, transported to a magical world of
							fairies and monsters in a quest to become a wizard
							and save his mother, who passed away in his world
							but remains alive in the other. Every character in
							Motorville has an analogue in the magic world, so
							occasionally you'll have to interact with characters
							in one world to alter another.
						</p>
						<p>
							An interesting concept that surely ties into the
							ideas of magical prowess and all, but the trips
							themselves strip the player of critical thinking
							opportunities by outright telling you what you have
							to do at all times. Side quest to fix a broken
							engine in the magic world? Your Navi-esque companion
							will mention to you that there's a mechanic in
							Motorville, for example. They never leave any room
							for the player to explore this dual-worlds mechanic
							in ways outside of the immediately obvious - and
							that constraint unfortunately becomes a running
							theme of the game.
						</p>
						<p>
							The inconsistent pacing of the story doesn't help.
							The first continent, The Summerlands, takes about
							10-12 hours to complete, but the next two take a
							cumulative 5 hours. At one point you fight three
							bosses in a total of 5 plot points, all of which
							happen with literal minutes between them. You
							receive the fast travel spell and the on-command
							dragon to fly around the world within an hour of
							each other, making both feel superfluous. It was
							little things like this that made the experience
							feel really unsure of it what it wanted to be -
							either whimsical gallivanting or this fast paced
							adventure, and often times it fell flat of either.
						</p>
						<p>
							Oliver's quest to become a wizard is no joke -
							you'll learn something close to 100 spells
							throughout your journey - but close to half of them
							merely appear in your Wizard's Companion and are not
							usable in-game. In others, they are used a single
							time to further a plot point or solve a puzzle, and
							never touched again. A firmly non-interactable
							environment also means you couldn't play around with
							spells in innocuous ways either, like shooting a
							"Quicken Growth" spell at a flower shop to see if it
							is overrun. Every opportunity to use magic is
							scripted and doesn't reward exploration or
							imagination at all.

						</figure>
						<p>
							The worst case of hand-holding comes with the Locket
							mechanic, which allows you to mend broken hearts by
							taking traits like confidence or kindness from those
							who have lots of it and giving it to those in need.
							These transactions comprise nearly half of all side
							quests in the game and they are necessary to
							progress the main plot at many critical junctures.
							It can be charming - you might need to give a queen
							with a large appetite some restraint, or a bored
							ruler some enthusiasm, for example. However, to
							flesh out Oliver as a polite 12-year-old boy, every
							interaction with someone with a desirable trait
							(even the 50th such person) starts with close to a
							dozen lines of dialogue of Oliver working up the
							nerve to ask them for their help, and your companion
							outright telling you which spell to use
							<i>and</i>
							which trait they are lacking. It's infantilizing,
							removing any ounce of thought to the situation.
						</p>
						<p>
							Across your journey, you'll pick up three other
							party members, all of whom can collect (and have
							preferences for certain types of) familiars, which
							are for all intents and purposes just
							<i>Pokemon</i>
							. The combat plays out in real time, with commands
							selected from a (very janky) wheel, playing out
							automatically followed by a cooldown timer. They can
							be canceled at any time, though, so you won't get
							stomped by an AoE attack from a boss because you
							were halfway through attacking instead of defending
							or evading.
						</p>
						<p>
							The most immediate problem with combat is the lack
							of control over the party. The options are for party
							tendencies when they're left to their own devices
							are painfully thin: you can't order them to attack
							the nearest enemy, only your target and not-your
							target; you can't order them to use MP
							conservatively, only all or nothing; you can't order
							them to be careful about defending themselves
							without your direct intervention. In most fights,
							your teammates will take a shitton of damage from
							not defending and blow all of their MP on healing
							themselves. It can work out for you, but nothing
							about it feels satisfying from a tactical
							standpoint. It is still very possible to take down
							creatures well above your level range with smart
							character switching, MP management, and simply
							physically moving out of the way of attacks.
							Familiars with high movement speeds became crucial
							to my style of attack by the endgame, as the ability
							to run out of range immediately was consistently
							useful for the sake of survival. That of course
							means that my party never once took advantage of it
							by themselves, but I digress.
						</p>
						<p>
							From a purely aesthetic standpoint, there is very
							little to complain about. As mentioned before (and
							nearly every time the game is brought up), the
							visual design was handled in part by Studio Ghibli
							to great effect, with whimsical, pastel color
							palettes, a tasteful cel shading effect to mirror
							the look of their 2D work, and a wide variety of
							interesting environments and towns. The world map
							itself that you traverse has some beautiful water
							and weather effects, and the masses of land
							(specifically the grassier hills) have a watercolour
							painting quality to them. The major characters also
							all had lovely Ghibli charm to them, with expressive
							animations and exaggerated regality.
						</p>
						<p>
							The only visual exception of quality was the
							familiar designs, stemming from a core issue of
							quantity. For some reason Level-5 decided that it
							would be a good idea to include 400 of them in the
							game, all collectable except for the bosses.
							However, a strong emphasis on evolution (with
							splintering paths at the final stage) means that out
							of the 350ish actual familiars in the game, there
							are really just 85 or so base designs with some
							slight changes. Every familiar has four similar
							variants, and that can make a journey through the
							world feel a lot less dynamic than it should.
						</p>
						<p>
							The soundtrack is also consistently quality, with
							the rather large caveat that the entire soundtrack
							is less than two hours long and will repeat early
							and often throughout the duration of the game. It
							just doesn't feel like the themes were meant for
							mass replayability as much as they were for
							cinematic purposes. Without fail, every first
							encounter of a theme in its environment took me
							aback (especially the title theme, "Golden,"
							"Drippy," and "Yule") and made me want to just sit
							around in the environment. The sound design in
							general was stellar, with solid SFX and brilliant
							voice work (at least on the English dub, which was
							what I played with).
						</p>
						<p>
							In all,
							<i>Ni no Kuni</i>
							is a game with a ton of problems that still gets a
							gentle recommendation from me on the condition that
							you have a lot of time on your hands and appreciate
							this brand of JRPG. It's got far too many bosses,
							doesn't really know how to pace its own story, is
							completely tedious in many cases, and has some
							unsatisfying combat systems in place - but it is
							still a relatively unique experience for a PS3
							exclusive, and aesthetically is an enormous success
							for a 7th gen title. It's clear that an enormous
							amount of time went into designing this world and
							its inhabitants, they just forgot to really polish
							the game part of it as well.

						<h2 id="subtitle">Donkey Kong Country (1994) - ★★★✩</h2>
						<p id="subtitle">
							<i>dev. Rare, dir. Tim Stamper & Chris Stamper</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							The Virtual Console and emulation are dreams come
							true. How incredible is it that I can play this
							acclaimed software released on now-obsolete hardware
							with near-perfect accuracy on pretty much anything I
							own with a screen? The future is great, hats off to
							all those working to preserve the work of game
							designers of years past.
						</p>
						<p>
							For the unfamiliar,
							<i>DKC</i>
							is a platformer where you play as Donkey Kong and
							Diddy Kong as you embark on a quest to take back
							your banana hoard and defeat King K. Rool. Taking
							damage rids you of your current Kong and swaps you
							to your partner, which is actually mechanically
							consequential. DK and Diddy do not feel the same,
							move the same, or jump the same. Diddy is the Luigi
							of DKC, with a faster run and a higher jump. He also
							holds barrels in front of him as opposed to above,
							allowing him to essentially use it as a buffer from
							damage whereas DK must throw them to be effective.
						</p>
						<p>
							While no main-path obstacle is character-exclusive,
							there are plenty of Diddy-only jumps for hidden
							secrets, meaning he's preferred in mostly every
							scenario. You'll begin to ask yourself questions
							that shouldn't exist: do I start as Diddy because
							it'll be easier, or keep him as my backup when I
							inevitably take damage? At least DK does prove his
							worth in the 4th world, though, where his heftier
							frame gives him more traction on icy platforms.
							Generally, the asymmetric hero dynamic is clever and
							encourages different playstyles on paper, but in
							execution it feels a bit unbalanced.

						</figure>
						<p>
							The actual levels are where the game shines
							brightest. The linear and straight-forward level
							design, usually revolving around one new mechanic
							per level, allows for the player to quickly
							understand how to progress. There is no getting lost
							or any real puzzles to solve, either - it's
							concentrated platforming, in a pure form, boss
							fights included. There isn't much verticality in
							these levels, allowing the natural left-to-right
							screen scroll to present each new obstacle to the
							player consistently and fairly. You will not be
							dropped in on, nor will you be required to make any
							leaps of faith; your only task is to tackle each
							challenge as it appears.
						</p>
						<p>
							The presentation is outstanding, with one of the
							best soundtracks ever made leading the player's
							charge through detailed and beautiful backgrounds. I
							used to hate the pre-rendered character models
							before I actually played it, but I can now find only
							endless charm in them. While the enemy models can
							range in quality, the two primate heroes
							consistently look good and fluid, as do the solid
							environments. The sound design is A+ across the
							board as well, with little touches I adore like your
							partner banging on the inside of a barrel if you
							only have one Kong remaining, or the little ASMR
							chomps the baby gators make to signal their
							impending arrival as you approach. You'll spend so
							much time in each level that seeing a still from the
							game will probably immediately transport you back to
							grinding that stage out.
						</p>
						<p>
							Donkey Kong Country is challenging, intuitive, and
							thoughtful, and outside of the then-standard lives
							mechanic clashing with its brutal difficulty (thank
							god for restore points) and some pre-rendered
							goofiness, it's translated pretty outstandingly to
							today. I've heard that the sequel fixes many of the
							problems of this title, and I can only hope they're
							right.

						<h2 id="subtitle">Mega Man X (1994) - ★★½✩</h2>
						<p id="subtitle">
							<i>dev. CAPCOM, dir. Tokuro Fujiwara</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							The first game Capcom made to bring the
							<i>Mega Man</i>
							formula into the 16-bit age of gaming,
							<i>Mega Man X</i>
							does an admirable job of evolving the original
							spirit of the classic NES titles. The new flagship
							mechanic of the
							<i>X</i>
							series is the ability to find permanent upgrades for
							your suit throughout the stages, hidden away in
							secret nooks. Along with max HP increases, and
							Sub-Tanks, which allow you to store "overflow"
							health caught by enemy drops, the titular X also
							receives substantial movement and damage upgrades.
							This spike in power makes this a good spot for
							newcomers - it's easier than most if not all of the
							mainline games preceding it.
						</p>
						<p>
							The game is much faster-paced thanks to the new
							dashing and wall-jumping mechanics, the latter
							opening up the levels to implement more verticality
							without being cumbersome. The boss count is upped to
							8 from 6, and they all look like something straight
							out of
							<i>Power Rangers</i>
							, too - huge, diabolical animals with an elemental
							theme and gimmick. They're all fair fights (Launch
							Octopus permitting), but just like the original
							series, it's hard to lose when you stumble upon the
							weapon they're weak to.
						</p>
						<figure class="dotted-line-above">
							<img src="../../img/games/saw-18/mmx.jpg" />
							<figcaption>
								I love this portly little secret boss, too. what
								a goof.
							</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							Expanding on the idea of the rock-paper-scissors
							boss weaknesses system of the classic
							<i>Mega Man</i>
							series is a new concept where entire stages can be
							altered by completing another before it. Defeating
							Storm Eagle causes his ship to crash into Spark
							Mandrill's factory, causing blackouts and making the
							electric flooring less dangerous. Defeating Chill
							Penguin makes the lava in Flame Mammoth's cave cool,
							allowing you to walk on it. While this is an
							engaging concept that lets you guess how certain
							stages will interact, it does make the "optimal
							path" even easier to determine. I personally found
							the two previous examples completely by accident,
							never seeing the original versions of those stages
							on my first playthrough.
						</p>
						<p>
							My complaints are minor. The first is that the game
							is just far too short. This was the first
							<i>Mega Man</i>
							title I played all the way through, and even with my
							struggles, I completed the entire thing in under 4
							hours. Experienced players who know the stages and
							the optimal routes could no doubt beat this game in
							around an hour and a half. It's hard to feel
							entirely fulfilled when the game passes by that
							quickly, even if some stages are revisited for
							secrets. I also found the soundtrack to be pretty
							inconsistent, with as many memorable tunes are there
							are grating ones. The SNES sound chip had weird
							limitations, but the synth tone on some of these
							tracks is just whiny.
						</p>
						<p>
							Overall, what you see is what you get: a fun game
							with a very short length, and it feels a bit like a
							Saturday morning cartoon in tone, art direction, and

							Half-Life: Opposing Force (1999) - ★★☆☆
						</h2>
						<p id="subtitle">
							<i>dev. Gearbox Software, dir. Randy Pitchford</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							An ambitious concept with non-ambitious execution.
						</p>
						<p>
							I can't shake the fact that this was marketed as a
							game where you are the antagonist military force
							from the original
							<i>Half-Life</i>
							. The expectation is that your team likely would
							have a set of clear objectives - including to snuff
							out witnesses of the event - that you would attempt
							to execute before shit hits the fan. On the
							contrary,
							<i>Opposing Force</i>
							begins with your platoon having no knowledge of the
							mission, and shit hitting the fan before you even
							get control of your character. When you come to,
							you're in the same position as Freeman: attempting
							to find some evacuation point from the facility
							while aliens roam the grounds. More of the same is
							good, but the point was missed.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the original game, you see militaristic cruelty
							towards the scientists in the facility, but here you
							are merely given indirect, anecdotal stories from
							scientists of other soldiers who have harassed them.
							You are not ever given orders to execute them,
							because your squad never received orders, and
							despite you being outranked by everyone you meet,
							they are under your command because you're the
							protagonist, or something. Only one event of
							soldier-scientist interaction do you actually see in
							person, and it's simply the scientist being
							(aggressively) held in a room to await evac. I
							cannot understate this - by the end of the game,
							Corporal Adrian Shepherd is even less aware of the
							military's actions than Freeman was.
						</p>

							<figcaption>
								seriously, this is it. literally one instance.
							</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							You are subject to battles with black ops agents and
							Xen aliens, same as Freeman. You have no more
							knowledge of the interior design of Black Mesa than
							Freeman did, despite working for the military that
							employs them. You crawl through the same vents, use
							most of the same weaponry, and solve similar
							long-form puzzles - including the Pit Worm section
							which is almost exactly the same as the Tentacle
							Pit. I don't think anybody wanted an expansion whose
							sole selling point was a new character perspective
							to be a watered down version of the base game.
						</p>
						<p>
							About halfway through the sewer section, I found
							myself asking if Shepherd has any unique advantages
							over Freeman, and the only answer I could muster was
							the occasional companionship of other soldiers,
							whose AI I personally found fairly frustrating to
							reign in. This isn't exactly
							<i>Brothers in Arms</i>
							, and their actual utility is drastically overstated
							in the tutorial. You'll hang onto a small group of
							soldiers for 20 minutes at the most, with 5 of those
							being futile attempts to get them to follow you. You
							also have the unique pleasure of occasionally having
							to utilize the worst rope physics of all time to
							cross a chasm. Great.
						</p>
						<p>
							Gearbox's failures can't take away from the fact
							that the original
							<i>Half-Life</i>
							was a masterpiece, and being able to experience more
							of it makes this recommended by default. Even though
							Shepherd knows almost nothing at all about what's
							going on, he is subject to interesting treatment
							from the G-Man, and he sees a side of the story that
							is unique in the Race X invasion (which was very
							hard for me to distinguish as a separate event from
							the Resonance Cascade, but we'll roll with it). The
							industrial-horror elements and tone are mostly
							preserved. On some very basic level, this is new
							content, and you get to see even more of the
							experimental weirdness in the facility.
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>Opposing Force</i>
							is absolutely a
							<i>Half-Life</i>
							game, and one worth playing simply to experience
							more of the magic that is the Black Mesa facility,
							but the opportunities Gearbox Software had to offer
							a truly unique perspective on the events of the base
							game were mostly squandered to preserve an acclaimed
							gameplay loop. For that, its lack of ambition makes
							it a much less memorable experience.

							Castlevania: Circle of the Moon (2001) - ★★☆☆
						</h2>
						<p id="subtitle">
							<i>dev. Konami, dir. Shigeharu Umezaki</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>Circle of the Moon</i>
							is a bit like playing
							<i>Symphony of the Night</i>
							as the Simon Belmont from the original
							<i>Castlevania</i>
							. If that sounds awkward, compromised, or maybe
							missing the point of
							<i>SOTN</i>
							, you'd be right. You play as Nathan Graves, a young
							vampire hunter who has inherited the legendary whip
							of Belmont fame. Dracula gets revived and kidnaps
							your mentor to prepare a blood rite, you set out to
							find him in Dracula's castle. Metroidvania ensues.
						</p>
						<p>
							An early frustration is Nathan's flexibility of
							attack, which not only no longer has the
							omni-directional whipping of
							<i>Super Castlevania IV</i>
							but also removed the 8-way whipping from
							<i>Rondo of Blood</i>
							. Since
							<i>Circle of the Moon</i>
							is a true metroidvania, you'll be moving vertically
							as much as you do horizontally, which means your
							limited attack ability is frequently annoying.
							Nathan is heavily reliant on subweapons, which are
							back in their
							<i>Rondo of Blood</i>
							form here. Generally, the level design feels like it
							was built for Alucard, and that leads to some
							awkwardness.
						</p>
						<figure class="dotted-line-above">
							<img src="../../img/games/saw-18/cotm.gif" />
							<figcaption>
								these save room cathedrals are sick, though.
							</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>
							You obtain special abilities that open up more parts
							of the castle, and while it's fun to keep a mental
							laundry list of potential places to backtrack,
							Nathan's stiff movement and jumping just do not feel
							very equipped for the environment before him. Add to
							the fact that his rigid, old-school Vampire Hunter
							persona means you won't be finding varying weapon
							types and you have a relatively flat experience
							compared to the other open-ended CV titles.
						</p>
						<p>
							There is magic in the game, in the form of the Dual
							Stack System, but its implementation is a bit weird.
							Essentially, there are two decks of 10 cards a piece
							that can be mismatched to give Nathan some extra
							abilities when the L button is toggled. Sometimes it
							adds more damage, or gives some kind of damage
							reduction bonus. Most are pretty useful and can help
							a ton in difficult boss fights. That said, these
							cards are found by very uncommon random drops of
							specific enemies in the castle, with no way of
							determining which is dropped and by whom without
							consultation of a guide. It's just a headache.
							Grinding for them can conflate with the regular ol
							EXP grinding you'll need to be doing, so
							<i>Circle of the Moon</i>
							at least combines its tedium.
						</p>
						<p>
							I still found the game to be fairly enjoyable, as
							it's got some high points, especially the amazing
							soundtrack. But the story is pretty generic and the
							protagonist is without real personality, the
							controls are frequently annoying, and frankly it's
							just not as fun to play the generic whip-toting
							Belmont type for the entirety of a backtrackathon. I
							think a bit too much was removed from the
							<i>SOTN</i>
							formula to try and accommodate all types of fan.

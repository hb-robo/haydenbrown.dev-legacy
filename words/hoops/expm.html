              In the spring of 2019, I tried to build an all-in-one aggregate
              NBA statistic. At the time I was a busy computer science undergrad
              with a penchant for procrastinating on the important things, and
              marrying my love for basketball with my growing skillset as a
              mathematician and programmer felt natural. In particular, I was
              drawn to the idea by
              <a href="https://twitter.com/JacobEGoldstein">Jacob Goldstein</a>,
              current research analyst for the Washington Wizards, Mystics, and
              Go-Go, who built the then-essential, now-proprietary PIPM
              statistic when he was an undergrad himself. It seemed like a
              reasonable endeavor and I felt prepared enough to try for myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              My vision was grand and naive. As a follower of the ever-miserable
              Chicago Bulls, I was frustrated by the most common source of
              confusion that stemmed from use of plus-minus derived aggregate
              stats like PIPM: the results. Low usage, high efficiency players
              from winning teams tend to be rewarded over high usage, medium
              efficiency players from losing teams, and why shouldn’t they, if
              they have a larger part of a team’s success? Isn’t winning why
              they play the game at all? It’s a reasonable conclusion, but it
              can misinform. For me, this came to a head when an elderly Bulls
              fan went on a Twitter rant claiming that he’d rather max Jeremy
              Lamb than Zach LaVine -
              <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm">ESPN’s RPM</a>
              (whose formula has since been revised) cited as the chief
              evidence.
            </p>
            <p>
              The argument can be made that we live in a world severed from
              widespread statistical comprehension. Mathematical communication
              has always been a problem for humans, but perhaps most famously we
              don’t find probabilities intuitive at all. The foundation of
              confusion in statistics lies in the strange, but accurate insights
              we are able to extract from computation, like why
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem"
                >it’s always beneficial to switch prizes</a
              >
              on the Monty Hall Show, or why
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem"
                >it’s more likely than not that 2 people in a room of 23 share a
                birthday</a
              >, despite 366 possible dates. For some reason, the human brain
              doesn't expect these outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite a gradual uptick in the comprehension of statistics in the
              broader NBA community, professional basketball is not an exception
              to the confusion; on the contrary, sports are possibly the most
              common arena for misunderstaning math, I imagine because it draws
              in people from a variety of backgrounds, not all technical. If you
              tell the average NBA fan that
              <a href="https://dunksandthrees.com/epm"
                >Dunks & Threes’ all-in-one stat EPM</a
              >
              ranks Jakob Poeltl as a better defender than Bam Adebayo, they
              might find it silly, or worse, use the existence of that fact to
              dismiss the site’s efforts entirely. The dissonance, however
              impacted by external factors like media coverage and marketing
              efforts it might be, creates a cultural divide between “the
              numbers” and “the game.”

              But what if those fans are right to call out the discrepancies? To
              me, there was nothing appreciably wrong with the top-down
              plus-minus approach, but if it didn’t match a de facto reality,
              shouldn’t it be held up to scrutiny? This was the question burning
              a hole in my pocket, the one I wanted to try to solve with my
              project.
            </p>
            <p>
              After some soul-searching and brainstorming about the math, I
              created a rough draft of what I called Experimental Plus-Minus
              (EXPM) - its key feature being a complete dismissal of plus-minus
              data, instead building the skillset of each player up from
              scratch. Similar methodology was adopted in the days where the box
              score was the only thing widely available, and metrics like PER,
              Win Shares, and Box Plus-Minus (BPM) were born. But in 2019, there
              was so much more to offer - extensive lineup data, robust
              defensive tracking, rough playtype frequencies, and so on. My plan
              was to take advantage of that newer, deeper NBA data to build a
              “smarter” version of those original box-score statistics.
            </p>
            <p>
              <i
                >(As you might have guessed, EXPM is a misnomer - the "PM" part
                of it makes no sense when plus-minus data isn't used. I
                genuinely just thought it would be funny if the statistic had a
                similar name to
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_point">EXP</a
                >, the basic character-leveling currency used in thousands of
                role-playing video games.)
              </i>
            </p>
            <p>
              EXPM was built to be comprised of multiple sub-statistics that
              calculated a player’s value in a particular useful area, which
              would then sum to the total. Not all areas were actually given
              representation, only a very Moreyball-charged subset that I, at
              the time, considered to be important to the sport: three-point
              shooting, passing, scoring at the rim, self-creation, and a
              clean-up component for offensive rebounds and screen assists.
              Everything else was completely omitted from the calculation, the
              theory being that in a modern game, only modern skills should be
              rewarded.
            </p>
            <p>
              In retrospect, my attempt is an unabashed failure at actually
              representing basketball value. My attempt at punishing inefficient
              players failed, as the bad shots were never considered in the
              formulation and thus couldn't hurt them. I never built the daily
              scraper to update the box score sources after new games had
              completed, instead working with outdated numbers until the regular
              season ended and there was no more need to pull them. Did I
              mention that I also never got around to the defensive half of this
              stat? Sometimes it just isn’t meant to be.
            </p>
            <p>
              I can’t even really dissect the mathematics of EXPM here, as most
              of it is beyond salvaging. Still, there are a few takeaways from
              EXPM that I think can help shed some insight on basketball numbers
              and what that information actually tells you.
            </p>
            <figure>
              <img src="../../img/hoops/expm/expm.jpg" alt="" />
              <figcaption>
                this is the only EXPM that actually works, am I right?
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Ultimately, EXPM’s fatal flaw was in the premise. Every time you
              build upwards from existing stats, you’re trapped by an unreliable
              present. While we might freely tease the first generation of
              aggregate stats today for their simplicity, their creators
              couldn’t yet factor in the wealth of information we’re able to
              access today because it just didn’t exist. They were advanced and
              all-encompassing for their time, but times change. Similarly, the
              “advanced box score” as we call it today might look paltry in
              another 30 years as automatic video trackers get more
              sophisticated, specifically on the defensive end. The platonic
              ideal of an all-in-one statistic is "good plays minus bad plays,"
              and that reality might be soon.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s also healthy to recognize that these numbers in the box score
              are just a low-resolution interpretation of a game that’s played
              in real life. The physics of the ball and the players colliding
              and bouncing alone is immensely complicated, with the difference
              between, say, a made pass for a 3 and a deflected pass hit out of
              bounds coming down to a matter of tiny micro angles of the ball
              leaving a player’s hands. Nearly infinite layers of complexity and
              nuance - defensive schemes, individual matchups and mismatches,
              set designs, physicality and positioning, footwork and speed
              changes, recent-possession momentum, nerves, confidence - go
              unquantified and unaccounted for in even the most advanced
              statistical suites available.
            </p>
            <p>
              When confronted by a game with innumerable missing data points,
              plus-minus data emerges as an incredibly elegant and brilliant
              solution. Working backwards from the results, factoring in who was
              on the court, during which minutes, against what competition, does
              capture quite a lot about the happenings of that game. If fifty
              factors influence the outcome of a basketball game, the on-off
              data will invariably capture them, or at least their “shadow” -
              manifesting as runs, stops, and streaks. This is still true if
              there are a hundred factors, or a thousand, or ten-thousand. While
              we can’t glean every insight from plus-minus data, it is still
              descriptive - and maybe comprehensive - in its own abstract,
              silhouetted way.
            </p>
            <figure>
              <img src="../../img/hoops/expm/topdown-vs-bottomup.png" alt="" />
              <figcaption>this also comes up in database design:</figcaption>
              <figcaption>
                <u>attribute</u>: "how good is PLAYER at SKILL?"
              </figcaption>

            </figure>
            <p>
              In contrast, bottom-up approaches must always be lossy, shedding
              holistic value as it incorporates more individual subfactors that
              may not paint the full picture. Worse still is that this can spark
              unproductive, unsolvable discussions about the relative value of
              basketball skills. If you build a statistic from the box score, by
              definition your statistic must be assembled using some formulation
              of that existing numeric data. Doing so can prompt debates that
              cannot be conclusively determined, like “how much should a point
              count versus an assist, or a rebound?” This ultimately makes the
              result of the statistic only as reliable and predictive as the
              basketball philosophy of the statistician, which may not even
              match reality at all.
            </p>
            <p>
              EXPM is absolutely littered with these decisions, because the
              advanced box score blows the door wide open on what can be
              considered a productive basketball event. How much should a
              passing assist be worth versus a screen assist? Both create a
              field goal attempt, but now you have to quantify the risk of a
              moving screen violation versus that of a passing turnover. How
              about the value of a contested rebound versus an uncontested one?
              Do you use raw assists or do you approximate "expected" assists by
              multiplying potential assists by the league average efficiency?
              Ultimately, these decisions vary from person to person, alterating
              (and obfuscating) the impact they aim to quantify.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is also a significant problem of “invisible” value. The
              plus-minus approach rightfully envisions a basketball games as a
              series of possessions with score consequences, but the box score
              does not abide by those rules. A good example is a possession
              wherein a player drives to the rim, kicking the ball out to a
              semi-open corner shooter who in turn swings it to a more open
              elbow shooter, who makes the shot. This happens all the time,
              whether it's Mike Conley to Joe Ingles to Bojan Bogdanovic, or
              Kyle Lowry to OG Anunoby to Gary Trent Jr.
            </p>
            <figure>

            </figure>
            <p>
              With the plus-minus approach, all three players (and their two
              other teammates) are rewarded for that successful play. From the
              box-score, unless hockey assists are implemented, the player that
              kicked off the sequence with the drive-and-kick goes completely
              unrewarded, instead resulting in an assist for the corner shooter
              and a made field goal for the elbow shooter. The two weak-side
              teammates whose non-presence made the sequence possible (maybe
              crucially stretching the floor to give a lane for the initial
              drive) get no credit at all. It’s a headache.

              Finally, EXPM fails because of intentional value overlap, where a
              single possession can positively or negatively impact a player
              more than once. Three separate sub-categories of EXPM -
              three-point attempts, at-rim attempts, and self-created attempts -
              can easily overlap with one another in two obvious and common
              examples: the self-created drive to the basket and the pull-up
              three pointer. These are incredibly valuable shots for a player to
              produce, arguably the most important in the sport right now, and
              because of that I didn’t mind that they were double-counted - I
              figured it was a reasonable reward. Still, “double” is a flippant,
              unscientific multiplier that isn’t really based in anything
              meaningful besides it being convenient for my calculation. Not
              only is it not elegant, but it's incomprehensible.

              There are still good uses for the box score. To determine who is
              the best at any individual skill, it's nearly impossible to take
              any other approach, and without it as a supplement to the
              aggregate stats, we lose a lot of definition. It obviously isn't
              tenable for the basketball community at large to talk exclusively
              in good/bad binaries when the beauty of the game lies in distinct
              playstyles, how they interact and clash, how a player might exceed
              or fall short of the sum of their parts.

              That said, it might really be time to hang up it up as formulation
              for any aggregate ranking. Even with the significantly more robust
              tracking in the modern day, the lingering issue of relative skill
              value is too large of an obstacle to reasonably surmise. Perhaps
              one day we might be able to mine plus-minus data and extract the
              exact value of every individually tracked box score stat, but
              today is not that day. Even if an answer is reached, it might not
              be consistent from year to year or even game to game, rendering it
              too unstable for widespread casual usage.

              I can't totally rule it out, maybe somebody out there that's both
              much smarter than I am and has more creative ways to leverage the
              ever-growing repository of NBA tracking data will crack the code.
              But one thing is for sure, there is no need for an EXPM or
              anything like it.

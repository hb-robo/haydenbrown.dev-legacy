This was my first personal portfolio site, launched in February 2021. It was hosted for a couple years at haydenbrown.dev, but has since been taken down. Aside from the typical about and projects page, it also served as the first public repository of my personal writing.

The site is made entirely out of handcrafted HTML5/CSS3, even the animations. I knew almost nothing about web development when I started the project, so it was an arduous process. The upkeep required to add new content is why it was left unmaintained, and why I started anew with Astro.js on [the rewrite](https://github.com/hb-robo/haydenbrown.dev).

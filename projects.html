							This place came about in February 2021. It was many

							built primarily with HTML/CSS, my first fully
							responsive webdev project, and my first experience
							with JavaScript.
						</p>
						<p>
							It initially began as a portfolio site, a way to
							bolster my resume in a very difficult job market
							following my graduation into a pandemic and
							recession. My ambitions for it quickly grew and it
							soon became a platform for my writing, all of which
							had been private previously.

						<img

							alt="A graph of missing data in a large R dataset"
						/>
						<p>
							In the Spring 2020 semester, I wrote a data science
							pseudo-research paper as a capstone project for my
							final college course: Statistical Bioinformatics. My
							partner and I evaluated the efficacy of missing
							value imputation methods in R, using
							family-associated genomic data.
						</p>
						<p>
							The project involved a thoroughly recorded
							exploration of family-wise data from snpStats,
							complete with visualization of missing values. The
							cleaned data was then put through an R pipeline that
							randomly removed a partition of values from the set.
							Using this "poked" set, a variety of freely
							available data imputation R packages were evaluated
							for their accuracy.
						</p>
						<p>
							Detailed explanations of of the data exploration,
							cleaning, and pipeline were compiled in a research
							paper-styled report in LaTeX.

						<p>
							In the Fall 2019 semester, I was a part of a
							two-person data analysis project spanning the entire
							semester of a course in Data Science Applications in
							Social Media. It was almost completely independent
							and involved multiple steps of data curation,
							cleaning, and analysis, culminating with a mock
							research paper of our findings.
						</p>
						<p>
							The pipeline used the Twitter 1% Stream API to
							scrape news articles from around 67 GB of tweet JSON
							files. Using a list of "valid" news sources per a
							panel of journalists, the links were evaluated for
							both their validty and bias, with additional
							analysis for the sources shared for specific
							trending political topics.

							developed but was ultimately dropped before the

						<p>
							In the Spring 2019 semester, I built a Ruby-on-Rails
							website in a group of 4 for a course in Software
							Engineering. The concept was a Yelp-like service
							where the user searches for specific food cravings
							instead of entire restaurants.
						</p>
						<p>
							It's a fairly robust vertical slice, with both food
							and restaurant search functionality, user profiles,
							login verification, and a comprehensive set of user
							actions including rating foods and adding menu items
							and restaurants to the database.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our class took very rigorous steps to simulate a
							semi-realistic Agile webdev environment. My job,
							outside of general database design and planning, was
							to develop lo-fi UI/UX sketches of each webpage and
							storyboard the navigation of the site as a whole.

						<p>
							In the spring of 2019, I made a pretty flawed NBA
							impact aggregate stat: Experimental Plus-Minus
							(EXPM). The project was an attempt to arrive at
							player value from the opposite direction of modern
							plus-minus stats. It instead identifies individual
							skills in players and builds them up into a holistic
							evaluation.
						</p>
						<p>
							EXPM is quite flawed. For one, trying to pigeonhole
							the ways players can create value is fairly
							unintuitive. It also has no defensive component, as
							it was more difficult to find good data for.
							Interestingly, the
							<a
								href="https://www.bball-index.com/lebron-database/"

								<b>LEBRON stat from BBall Index</b>
							</a>
							, despite its awful name, takes a similar approach

						<p>
							From spring 2018 until summer 2019, I was a part of
							an undergraduate research team for the Binghamton
							computer science department. Our goal was to use
							patterns of k-mers (variably lengthed substrings of
							RNA strands) to identify strands of the
							<i>Flaviviridae</i>
							virus family in animal waste.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our pipeline parsed FASTA files into string objects,
							collected all k-mer counts of a given k range,
							filtered out statistically insignificant k-mers
							using a Kruskal-Wallis algorithm, and classified
							viral strands with an SVM. We met weekly for pair
							programming sessions, and presented our findings
							with virologists from The Cary Institute and Arizona
							State University.
						</p>

							never ended with publication.

							In February 2018, a few of my close friends and I
							entered our first 24-hour Hackathon, Binghamton
							University's HackBU. Our final submitted project, a
							neural network that could evaluate any news link for
							its "validity" using a variety of feature proxies,
							would go on to take the first overall prize.
						</p>
						<p>
							All of us were inexperienced at the time, and as
							such we spent most of the night pouring over
							TensorFlow documentation. The final neural net
							evaluates articles based on their reading level,
							host geolocation, the age of the hosting source, its
							similarity to other articles (as many fake news
							sites upload in batches), and a variety of word
							processing tools including a typo scraper.
						</p>
						<p>
							The neural net was trained on catalogued instances
							of fake and "real" news (the latter including satire
							sources like The Onion), and it was able to evaluate
							news validity with a >95% success rate.

              <i>
                In the early winter of 2019, I began to take up games writing as
                a full-time hobby, replacing my previous love of digital music
                diving entirely. This is a chronological, lightly edited sample
                of the (finished) write-ups from that year. Nearly all of these
                were written for and published on Glitchwave.com, and as such
                the tone is more casual and explanatory.

            <h2 id="subtitle">Metroid Fusion (2002) - ★★½✩</h2>
            <p id="subtitle"><i>dev. Nintendo R&D1, dir. Yoshio Sakamoto</i></p>
            <p>
              <i>Metroid Fusion</i> is a game that mostly ignores and
              streamlines the most essential elements of its franchise's design
              before it. As much as I enjoy the game, that is true, and it is
              going to piss people off, so it has to be mentioned.
              <i>Fusion</i> takes the unique approach to ramp up narrative
              tension to create fear, mostly driven by Samus herself in
              monologues that reveal here uneasiness about her surroundings. How
              much it will appeal to you is inversely related to how much you
              value the open-ended, player-driven discovery of the previous
              entries in the series, namely <i>Super Metroid</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Samus's mission is to navigate a space ship to hunt down remnants
              of the X parasite - intelligent amorphous beings that completely
              consume organic life and then gain the ability to mimic it. She
              narrowly survives a battle with X, which melds her power suit with
              her body and removes some of her essential abilities. Meanwhile,
              the X gains the ability to assume the fully-powered Samus form,
              and this mindless new being known as "SA-X" is out to hunt you
              down.
            </p>
            <p>
              The best parts of previous entries in the series, in my opinion,
              were not scripted - they were directly tied to your progression of
              mastering the cryptic world before you, discovering items to help
              you continue. Falling down the Red Tower in
              <i>Super Metroid</i> and being forced to navigate the insanely
              hostile Norfair to find the Ice Beam before you could ascend once
              again was an extremely powerful moment. <i>Fusion</i> has no
              moments like these, because the ship's AI will always point you to
              your next objective, and generally each area has enough doors
              locked when you first arrive that progression is effectively
              linear. It feels weird, and if it weren't for the the game's
              branding, I think many could mistake this for a different series
              entirely.
            </p>

              <figcaption>saving the animals confirmed CANON.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              But the aesthetic qualities can't be avoided here. In previous
              entries, quiet save rooms and elevators meant a peaceful reprieve.
              In <i>Fusion</i>, every time I was alone I even more vulnerable
              than before, because things are liable to go very wrong very
              often. The game will lead you in a loop around an area to grab an
              item and by the time you are back at the start of the area, you'll
              see huge, blown apart paths that SA-X has been making in the
              direction that you initially headed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even if nothing actually happens outside of scripted moments, I
              did feel that there was a real "sense" of being chased by a force
              much stronger and crazier than you. Without too much detail, the
              final point in the story that made me feel the game had something
              special brewing was that your mindless fetch questing eventually
              turns kind of insidious as you realize you're not sure where your
              objectives are coming from.
            </p>
            <p>
              It might scare off some die-hard <i>Super Metroid</i> enthusiasts,
              but to its credit, <i>Fusion</i>'s curated action-horror romp is
              really well done. The plot is <i>Metroid</i> meets
              <i>The Thing</i> meets <i>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</i>. There
              might be a world of difference in design between <i>Fusion</i> and
              the more exploration-leaning entries in the series, but it's such
              a radical departure and good enough story that I still absolutely
              think it's worth a playthrough.

            <h2 id="subtitle">Shovel Knight (2014) - ★★★✩</h2>
            <p id="subtitle"><i>dev. Yacht Club, dir. Sean Velasco</i></p>
            <p>
              <i>Shovel Knight</i> is a passion project to the fullest extent,
              with healthy nods to at least a dozen classic NES titles -
              especially <i>Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</i>,
              <i>Castlevania</i>, <i>Super Mario Bros. 3</i>, and most
              importantly the <i>Mega Man</i> franchise and <i>DuckTales</i>.
              The gameplay is centered around two button presses only, feels
              optimized for a d-pad, and follows a very straightforward, gated
              level structure. With a couple modern features like autosaving
              aside, this basically plays like the best NES game ever made.
            </p>
            <p>
              The best two parts of <i>Shovel Knight</i> are the fantastic
              controls and level design, which feel completely in sync. The low
              overall level count produces a non-stop stream of quality, every
              single screen feeling well-tested and tightly designed with the
              level's core mechanics in mind. Each new enemy or platform
              mechanic is introduced in a safe way and ramps up the difficulty
              of the challenge iteratively, with the most difficult gauntlets
              guarding treasure in tucked-away secret areas. I never felt like
              the controls betrayed me, or that any level was designed in a way
              that was unfair. Each main stage has a copious amount of secrets
              to find and treasures to collect, and a really fun boss fight to
              close it.
            </p>
            <p>
              There's also an item system that works similarly to that of
              <i>Simon's Quest</i>, where you'll buy them from a shop and then
              can use them in stages for various effects. There is a simple
              magic system that is a bit like <i>Castlevania</i>'s hearts, that
              limit abuse of these items especially during boss fights. They
              often double as weapons and utilities, but none of them ever felt
              over-powered in combat scenarios (outside of the the Phase
              Locket), and even with the ones that increase your mobility, you
              can't just Rush-boost through a room and ignore its primary
              challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is also no life system, an antiquated piece of game design
              that I have chastised many times because gates content based on a
              "streak" of good play. Instead, upon death you lose a percentage
              of your money and have a chance to retrieve it if you return to
              the place of your demise on the next life. This option is
              significantly more player-friendly and flexible, especially when
              compounded by another mechanic where checkpoints can be
              permanently destroyed for a bit of coin. If you're confident, you
              can rush through the stage with the hopes of returning a greater
              fortune. Personally, though, I never found this necessary, since
              there was not a lot to buy and there was plenty of treasure to
              discover, but it's an interesting player decision that rewards
              multiple playstyles.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aesthetically, I enjoyed pretty much everything the game had to
              offer. The art direction is charming and well-drawn, with simple
              animation - the retro "cutscenes" like the King Troupple dance
              feel period-appropriate (and adorable). That said, the star of the
              presentation is without a doubt the ridiculously good chiptune
              soundtrack by Jake Kaufman and Manami Matsumae. Melodically it's
              just out of this world from front to back, so much so that I was
              humming some tunes for days after playing. The music is used as a
              tone-setting device, aiding the game;s flips between a campy
              adventure and an emotional journey. This is a strong contender for
              best soundtrack of 2014, period, and it's listenable outside of
              the game with little effort.

              After finally getting around to it in 2019, I feel kind of silly
              for waiting half a decade to jump on the bandwagon -
              <i>Shovel Knight</i> is a genuinely well-designed in just about
              every aspect. The only things that stick out to me are some
              in-game economy imbalances not really requiring the player to take
              the risks the game presents, the Troupple ichors being obviously
              unbalanced in favor of the Ichor of Renewal, and NG+ changing
              extremely little about the game besides turning wall chicken into
              bombs. Outside of those quibbles, I fail to see what it does not
              accomplish in the scope of its vision. Whether that vision
              satisfies you is another question.

              Shovel Knight: Plague of Shadows (2015) - ★★★✩
            </h2>
            <p id="subtitle"><i>dev. Yacht Club, dir. Sean Velasco</i></p>
            <p>
              <i>Plague of Shadows</i> is the first of supposedly four free DLC
              expansions for <i>Shovel Knight</i>, and value terms this is as
              generous as it gets. The campaign runs about as long as the base
              game (8 hours if you're like me and poke around everywhere for
              secrets), and it was for zero dollars. Zero! When I wrote about
              <i>Shovel Knight</i>, I had genuine difficulty thinking of valid
              critique. I hold the base game in extremely high regard and I was
              worried that a dramatic shift in playstyle would lose some of the
              tightly-snug mechanical magic. While there are some problems
              overall, this is one of the best expansions I have ever played.
            </p>
            <p>
              The story follows Plague Knight in a plot that runs concurrently
              to the original campaign, and explains a fair bit about the
              characters and world that might have gone unnoticed in the base
              campaign. Plague Knight finds and trades the relics that Chester
              eventually sells to you. He mass-murders the guards in the Hall of
              Champions, showing how it got to be so haunted. The very ending,
              which I won't spoil, is direct proof that Plague Knight is
              responsible for some of the trauma of the original ending. This
              interwoven aspect of storytelling was consistently engaging,
              especially the Batcave-esque secret lair in Mona's room in the
              Village. You really do feel like a villain, sneaking around and
              causing mayhem.

            </figure>
            <p>
              Plague Knight himself is a much more reckless play experience than
              Shovel Knight, which I feel complements their character designs
              well. While Shovel Knight was rigorously consistent and balanced,
              Plague Knight is decidedly not. He can explode himself across
              stages, whip up a large number of bomb variants on the fly, and
              cast a fair bit of magic that helps with platforming and combat.
              This looseness and speed at which PK operates is such a departure
              from the base game that I think many will struggle with the jump
              as I did.
            </p>
            <p>
              The bomb jump in particular has an absurd angle difference between
              no dpad input and left/right input, so simple mistakes like that
              could easily cost you your life. It can be frustrating and hard to
              reign in, which I think is something important to note when the
              base game was much more forgiving in its design. For that reason
              alone I think the gameplay falls a bit short of the main campaign,
              but it's still a worthy change up when you are able to control PK
              with some level of proficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most of the levels are close to identical to their SK
              counterparts, with a couple changes to better complement the new
              moveset. However, the differences in which PK and SK can traverse
              the environment made some relatively simply exercises for SK feel
              like proper puzzle challenges for PK. It was really refreshing to
              figure out how to continue instead of just executing. There was a
              similar concept of re-learning when you encounter enemies that are
              easier (knights, Mole Knight) or more difficult (dragons, Polar
              Knight) to defeat in your new form. It's like a whole new game.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, PK has a different motive for visiting all of the Order
              of No Quarter - he seeks each Knight's essence to concoct a potion
              that would give him unlimited power. He states it is for
              alchemical glory (the townspeople don't like him much), but in
              reality it's just to impress Mona, his partner in crime and love
              interest. In fact, despite the dastardly mayhem of Plague Knight's
              campaign, I thought the story was as good or better than the base
              game, as you figure out that he's acting out as a defense
              mechanism for his social ineptitude.
            </p>
            <p>
              He's nervous around his crush and just wants to be liked by
              people, but he just does not understand how to foster positive
              relationships. The simple drive to see him and Mona end up
              together despite their bickering was enough for me to keep going,
              and the ending is very satisfying and heartwarming. In terms of
              storytelling tone, <i>Shovel Knight</i> was something like
              adventure-hides-trauma. <i>Plague Knight</i>, in that sense, is
              debauchery-hides-loneliness, and I found it personally more
              compelling as a character drama.
            </p>
            <p>
              I don't think I could recommend this highly enough. It's almost as
              good as the already outstanding base game on the mechanical front,
              and in terms of the world and storytelling I'd argue it reaches
              even higher highs. Absolutely worth the time it takes to re-learn
              how to play the game, and come on, it's free.

            <h2 id="subtitle">Day of the Tentacle (1993) - ★★★✩</h2>
            <p id="subtitle"><i>dev. LucasArts, dir. Tim Schafer</i></p>
            <p>
              <i>Day of the Tentacle</i> is the third game Tim Schafer worked
              on, following the first two <i>Monkey Island</i> titles, and his
              first as co-director with LucasArts legend Dave Grossman. Coming
              off of the heels of those meta, comedy swashbuckling successes,
              this sequel-by-name to <i>Maniac Mansion</i> had lofty goals, both
              stylistically and in gameplay design, and its end product is in my
              opinion a couple steps above its predecessors.
            </p>
            <p>
              In an attempt to return a single day into the past to stop a
              maniacal Tentacle creature from gaining malicious
              superintelligence and conquering the world, the diamond powering
              your time machine explodes, sending our protagonists Hoagie,
              Laverne, and Bernard 200 years in the past, 200 years in the
              future, and back to the present day, respectively. While they can
              communicate with each other through the time machines, they do not
              have any power sources to return to the present, making it your
              main goal to help Hoagie and Laverne return to the present so they
              can try the experiment again and save humanity. Hoagie is sent to
              colonial America, at the Constitutional Convention, while Laverne
              appears in a world where the Tentacles already rule the Earth.
            </p>
            <p>
              The game's art direction is top notch and really sells the tone.
              It takes a lot of inspiration from the scratchy, off-kilter,
              Saturday morning cartoons of the 1990s: complete with standard
              youth stereotypes of the time as main characters, complete
              sociopaths everywhere, and genuinely disturbing concepts washed
              over in absurdist comedy. The peak of this is Laverne's
              experiences in a world where humans are domesticated as Tentacle
              pets, as she encounters both humans who are completely docile and
              love their owners and those too dejected to even want to escape to
              freedom. It's creepy stuff, but the next minute you're listening
              to the founding fathers roast John Hancock for having a cold.

                they even have the equivalent of dog shows.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Schafer and Grossman also make genuine mystery out of the mundane,
              like a visit from the IRS arriving and keeping Dr. Fred hostage
              while dressed like the Men in Black. The lighthearted tone brings
              together these disparate concepts, even when they exist in direct
              contrast to one another, and it makes the world more interesting
              than if it were entirely disturbing (e.g. <i>I Have No Mouth</i>)
              or a completely humorous one (e.g. <i>Monkey Island</i>). It has
              depth, and that gives this game staying power.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most gameplay in <i>Day of the Tentacle</i> is standard
              point-and-click affair, you collect items and use them in
              situations that give you new items, so on and so forth until you
              accomplish your goals, with the twist of sending some items
              through time to another character so they can make use of it. The
              most interesting puzzles for me were the ones where you needed to
              get an object in one timeline to a different one without the time
              machine, because of its size, sentience or perhaps because you
              need it to age into something. These "plumbing" problems really
              tested your knowledge of the different environments and what each
              timeline had in common with one another, making them a little more
              cerebral than simply swapping items among the characters.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, there were a handful of puzzles that used literal joke
              logic (though nothing as egregiously bad as
              <i>Monkey Island 2</i>'s monkey wrench), and a couple that would
              only be easily apparent depending on the type of person you are:
              namely if you understand what vinegar is and can come from or if
              you're okay with harming old ladies unprompted. All in all,
              though, I was less frustrated with this puzzle set than most all
              of LucasArts' predecessors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of a relatively tame ending, I was enthralled with the
              setting and characters throughout the entire 6/7-hour experience,
              and I really enjoyed learning how to tackle three sets of
              time-bending environmental puzzles at once. The interweaving
              environments bring a very unique approach to problem-solving, and
              the surreal comedy makes <i>Day of the Tentacle</i> a true time
              capsule of the era, no pun intended.

            <h2 id="subtitle">Grim Fandango (1998) - ★★½✩</h2>
            <p id="subtitle"><i>dev. LucasArts, dir. Tim Schafer</i></p>
            <p>
              <i>Grim Fandango</i> is seen as something of a swan song for the
              era of point-and-click adventure games from the late 80s through
              the late 90s. Director Tim Schafer was coming off of two straight
              commercial successes and cult favorites in
              <i>Day of the Tentacle</i> and <i>Full Throttle</i>, and was
              appropriately given a three-year development cycle to work with -
              an uncommonly large amount of time given how quickly their studio
              was able to churn out adventure games in that period. Although it
              ended up as a commercial failure and inadvertently ended the
              point-and-click era at LucasArts, <i>Grim Fandango</i> still has a
              lot to say, even if it hasn't aged as well as others in the
              catalogue.
            </p>
            <p>
              The game has the same unfortunate fate that many late 90s games
              fell prey to - pre-rendered backgrounds of a very low resolution
              that are hard to ignore or smooth over as time passes. To properly
              remaster games like these, you must either have high-definition
              renders of the backgrounds in question (impossible), or to rebuild
              them all from scratch, which could take years. Double Fine chose
              to leave the backgrounds alone in their remaster for
              <i>Grim Fandango</i> with newer, high-res foreground models,
              something of a half-solution. Nevertheless, the clash of
              resolutions is somewhat resolved by a strong art direction and
              interesting locations throughout.
            </p>
            <p>
              The entire game is played for the narrative to unfold, so I'll
              spare the details, but the main story beats hit at a pace
              consistent with a crime noir film, while optional conversations
              and poking around offer a really deep sense of world building. The
              game takes place in one year intervals, but you gain control of
              our protagonist, Manny Calavera, at the end of these intervals, so
              part of the fun is just figuring out what he's been up to the
              previous year of in-game time by interacting with locals and
              getting a glimpse of their interpersonal history. Manny is a
              genuine guy, if a bit sleazy and boneheaded (hah), but he's also
              quick on his feet and has no aversion to making a fool of himself
              just to make a bit of progress towards his goals - sort of like
              Threepwood before him.

                there's a legendary subplot where you give literal worker bees
                the gift of Marx.

            </figure>
            <p>
              The actual gameplay is pretty pure point-and-click, picking up
              items and using them in the correct places to make progress
              through an area, but the entire experience is encumbered by a
              clunky inventory system that requires you to stop the action,
              thumb through your items one at a time, and then watch an
              animation for each one until you find the one you need. Sounds a
              bit nitpicky but the sheer amount of interactions you'll have with
              your coat pocket will cause you notice it quickly and eventually
              come to lament its implementation.
            </p>
            <p>
              I thought the inventory was built like that because there isn't a
              need for any interaction between items, but in the final act there
              is a single time this is needed to happen and I actually talked
              myself out that possibility as a solution (even though it was
              necessary) just because it had never happened before in the
              previous 7 hours. Lo and behold, I had to use on item with a
              table, and then again with the other. Completely unprecedented and
              confusing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Still, the entire Year 2 in Rubacava is legitimately fantastic,
              from a design and structural standpoint. It feels like the best
              possible case for a smoky, comedic noir game such as this, and I
              still will remember it fondly. The other years not reaching the
              same height is unfortunate, but not enough to rescind a
              recommendation - and that's coming from someone who's usually not
              that interested in plots in games at all. I really think this one
              is worth spending some time with, if you're comfortable knowing
              that there will be some issues along the way.
            </p>
            <p>
              A sequel is probably never going to happen, and it might not need
              to the way the story ends, but a similar tale in the same world or
              with similar ambitions, with refined gameplay aspects and maybe
              some modern inclusions like a branching dialogue tree or disjoint
              character choices could be genuinely enthralling. As of now, Grim
              Fandango lives on as a time capsule of late-90s game design, for
              better and worse.

            <p>
              <i>Borderlands</i> is the most 2009 game ever made. It is an
              abominable Frankenstein's monster of role playing elements and
              skill trees, needlessly crude humor, film/games/music "references"
              culture, primitive open world design, rigid mission-based game
              structure, and an unabashed obsession of gore, violence, and guns.
              It also manages to thread these seemingly endless and disparate
              points of inspiration into something cohesive, addicting, and
              clever enough that it actually appears somewhat effortless in its
              execution.
            </p>
            <p>
              In <i>Borderlands</i>, you are the Vault Hunter - a mercenary
              trying to track down the Vault, an ancient dimensional portal
              filled with enough resources to bring anyone unimaginable wealth
              and power across the galaxy. To get there, you have to traverse
              the absurdly violent Pandora, a planet full of insane bandits,
              giant insects, flying birds the size of cars, vicious skags and
              spiderants, a highly-advanced capitalist militia taking everything
              of value from the planet, and an uncountable number of people
              trying to mislead you, kill you, manipulate you, and take your
              findings for their own. You travel across a number of increasingly
              more dangerous areas, taking down regional scourges and acquiring
              parts of the key to the Vault to complete your destiny.
            </p>
            <p>
              While that might sound like a <i>Godfather</i>-esque narrative
              adventure, it really isn't. Though there are some "twists," your
              player character does not directly speak with any character, does
              not have options for dialogue or quest plotlines, and generally
              experiences the plot as much as you do. The game features a
              barrage of characters, some friendly and some not, and while I
              consider the game to have passable writing, the quantity is simply
              not there, and that will either turn people on or off from what
              the game is trying to do. This is not <i>Fallout</i> - many
              explanations for why quests are being assigned and how they are
              being resolved and rewarded by the client are in a flash of text
              on a HUD menu. Make no mistake, this is a game about shooting
              things and feeling powerful before literally anything else.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pandora itself is a cel-shaded wasteland of deserts, mountains,
              rotting caves, shantyhouses, tented encampments, ghost towns,
              malfunctioning industrial plants, and gang hideouts. It takes
              obvious inspiration from <i>Mad Max</i>, but also stuff like
              <i>Grindhouse</i> and other high-octane mid-00s gorefest flicks,
              Westerns, slapstick comedy, and of course the chief inspiration
              for the game's visual direction, the short film
              <i>Codehunters</i>. What helps sell the place as real is how
              doggedly commited Gearbox is to making sure you know what Pandora
              is.

            <p>
              Almost every single area is a sunbaked rock face or coastline. The
              waters are unilaterally polluted. Most private citizens either
              never come outside or have disfigurations or illnesses. There are
              no paradise cities, no oases, no bastions of modernized
              civilization. It is always hostile, all the time, and you'll
              eventually find comfort in the familiarity. While you poke around,
              the soundtrack is a really fitting whirlwind of slide guitar,
              tribal drums, throaty horns, dilapidated strings, and dark
              ambient. Pandora sounds tired and dying, much like its inhabitants
              that you'll meet.

              Despite its interesting world, the game actually disincentivizes
              independent exploration outside of a few occasions. While there
              are literally thousands of weapon chests, lockers, ammo crates,
              safe boxes, dumpsters, mailboxes, and bodies to loot, every area
              on a given map was created first and foremost as the backdrop for
              a quest. In fact, this is so consistently true that you will find
              yourself actually refusing to poke around an area more than
              required for the mission, because if you haven't seen a place in
              the map yet there's a near-100% chance you'll be back later with
              another quest objective in hand. Instead, those loot vessels
              described earlier are meant to be stacked along with quest bonuses
              and rewards to create a non-stop flood of stuff for you to purse
              through. This makes sense from a setting standpoint, but I can
              imagine this putting off those who like that aspect of role
              playing games. For me, the pace of the game is key and this helps
              mosey along the content at a fun briskness.

              <i>Borderlands</i> was branded as a "first person <i>Diablo</i>"
              and frankly that's the mechanical base of the experience. Enemies
              explode like pinatas of limbs, glibs, cash, and loot and when you
              are even a few levels above your opponent you will start to
              one-shot them and receive a pittance of 1 XP for your troubles.
              Progression through the game is lightning quick, and they
              encourage you to always be improving, rifling through new guns in
              your inventory, and selling the old stuff you don't need.
            </p>
            <p>
              From the various mission hubs in the game, a typical "cycle" of
              gameplay is to accept every mission you have unlocked, go to the
              area most of them align in, complete them all in one swath, come
              back and rake in the rewards and loot, sell the surplus loot you
              don't need or grew out of, and take on more missions again.
              Initially limited inventory space also means the player will learn
              to do mental math quickly, as they calculate DPS for a weapon on
              the ground and evaluate its usefulness. Mercifully, there is a
              color-coded rarity system to help players quickly determine what
              they should probably make room for.
            </p>
            <p>
              The guns, grenades, and shields themselves are randomly generated,
              with an outrageous number of permutations. This gives a very
              literal equipment hierarchy for not only you but every enemy
              around you, because their gun is yours as soon as you kill them. A
              large majority of the stuff you find will have flaws in some form,
              but every once in a while you will find a total death machine that
              allows you to ravage another hundred potential replacements. The
              thrill of finding a replacement to one of your 4 gun slots is
              really intoxicating, and it helps the player push forward through
              otherwise tedious portions of the game. Many map sub-areas have at
              least one hidden chest in them, so looking around a bit or using
              your ridiculous <i>Halo</i> jump to climb some structures is
              usually a good use of your time.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to the onslaught of items you'll have, you also level
              up, and in addition to base stat improvements you'll have skill
              points to unlock abilities in one of 3 class-specific skill trees.
              Having played through the game with 3 of 4 of the characters I can
              say that they are balanced quite well and all feature cool, unique
              abilities that change how you'll approach both combat and your gun
              prioritization. Lilith's absurd elemental bonuses will incentivize
              you to keep those element-charged guns. Roland's ammo
              replenishment and turret health regen will keep you well armed and
              alive more often than the others. Mordecai's bonuses for critical
              hits and snipers will make many encounters trivial for those who
              can aim. I'd recommend looking at the skill trees for each
              character beforehand to get an idea how they play, because it's a
              highly personal choice, even if you end up roughly as strong in
              the end.

              <i>Borderlands</i> makes good use of its excellent controls and
              gunplay, addictive loot system, and setting to create something
              that is worth a play for both the <i>Call of Duty</i> and the
              <i>Fallout</i> crowds. It is a very competent combination of
              traditional first person shooters and open world role playing
              experiences with a unique visual style and memorable world to
              conquer. Although I still enjoy it a decade after its release, the
              sequels have revealed that <i>Borderlands</i>' simplicity and
              accessibility is also its content downfall. To the pessimist, this
              world may seem empty and overly hostile, with not enough variety
              to offer. For those who embrace the narrow lane this game is
              trying to pave, you will find a lot to offer.

              <i>Portal</i> is a game so obviously good it's probably a waste of
              time to prattle on about in a formal way. Instead, I'll just share
              some of my experiences with the game and how I think it holds up
              on my playthrough of it yesterday, the 12th of August, 2019.
            </p>
            <p>
              I first played through this game in the most abominable way
              possible - by way of the console port of <i>The Orange Box</i> for
              Xbox 360 back in 2008. Although the controls limited some
              functionality and it wasn't nearly as pretty or smooth as the PC
              original, I was utterly obsessed with the original
              <i>Portal</i> and how unique it was. It took the industrial horror
              influence of Valve's previous <i>Half-Life</i> titles and painted
              over it with a pristine, hostile white, letting it slowly chip
              away and erode along with your feelings of security and comfort.
              <i>Portal</i> is not about being tested, it is about the nature of
              testing - being a pawn for some hidden authority, the isolation
              and disconnect from reality, the helplessness and desire for
              escape.
            </p>
            <p>
              What helps sell the setting of Aperture Science is not a lengthy
              campaign with rigorous puzzles and world building, it's actually
              how far GLaDoS goes to prevent you from figuring out what's going
              on, and how fantastic the pacing of this "paint peeling back"
              occurs over the utterly cinematic 2-hour runtime of the game.
              There are essentially 3 acts of the game: 1) simple puzzles and
              building the skillset, 2) being confronted with the fact that you
              are being misled by your AI companion by way of the Ratman's lairs
              and her gradual accumulation of lies to you, and 3) executing the
              escape when you are left with no other choice, using what you have
              learned to break out of the facility. This is done so goddamn well
              and none of it is accomplished through cutscenes or scripted
              sequences. Your perspective is never altered, and it is up to you
              to make these events happen in real time.
            </p>
            <p>
              The most underrated portion of this game to me is the sound
              design. Outside of one of the actual best ambient soundtracks in
              the history of music, with tracks that knaw at your insecurities
              as a test subject in a confined space and amplify the sci-fi
              thriller pacing, every sound effect is outstanding and leaves a
              mental impression. I think many people who have played this game
              can remember the sound of a portal being deployed, of a switch
              being depressed, of the energy ball keys flying around the test
              chambers, of the off-kilter moan of the elevator moving you to a
              new floor. Of course, just like its mechanical evolution and story
              twists, the music abruptly hits a stride and becomes adrenaline
              pumping electronica that lets you know that you are in DANGER and
              need to act.

              Above all else, Valve managed to make a game that was carried
              plot-wise by a single character with voice lines in GLaDoS, who is
              outstandingly written and conveys her gradual loss of control in a
              very convincing and creepy way. The mechanical hum of her voice
              and Microsoft Reader-esque way that certain words are always
              enunciated gives a serious HAL-9000 vibe to her character. The way
              her voice flips when you melt her morality core is also just
              sinister and incredible voice acting work by actress Ellen McLain.
              From an audio standpoint, <i>Portal</i> might top Valve's already
              outstanding resume of sound design.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are only minor things that hold this game back from
              perfection: the omnipresence of the janky Source engine when
              interacting with stuff like cubes that regularly remind me this is
              not just a game but an old one, and the overall low difficulty of
              the test chambers before they let you loose through Aperture, as
              the puzzles after you receive both ends of the portal gun ramp up
              slightly and then plateau. Quibbles aside, I don't think you'll
              find a better 2 hours of game anywhere else in the world. Despite
              being published by a major force in the industry in 2007,
              <i>Portal</i>'s success was a sign the gaming world was ready for
              the avant-garde and surreal, and it's one of the most developed
              concepts and executions in gaming history.

            </p>
            <p>
              <i>Portal 2</i> is a game that actually manages to end up lesser
              than its predecessor despite an expansion of nearly every concept,
              proving that more is not always more. <i>Portal 2</i> has more
              dialogue, more humor, more characters, more puzzle mechanics, more
              locations, more visual spectacle, more secrets, a much longer
              story with three distinct acts as long as the entirety of the
              original game, and a sprawling co-op mode with tons of missions to
              work out, but it still finds itself to be a dramatically inferior
              experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lengthy loading screens of generic Aperture logos are incredibly
              frequent and jarring. UI hints and tips pop up for the first 3
              hours of the game to teach you how to play. Whichever AI is
              currently traveling with you is constantly hurling advice and
              instructions to proceed through the environment. <i>Portal</i>'s
              hands-off approach to navigation and problem-solving, as well as
              its commitment to player immersion, are mostly absent here. To
              compensate, we get a slightly altered tone - one of comedic
              lathering rather than isolation or anxiety. There was a really
              great opportunity to re-invent some of that tension in Act 2 in
              old Aperture, and Valve fumbled it with big cartoony lighting, a
              jokey omnipresent voice of J.K. Simmons as founder Cave Johnson,
              and, of course, your forced hangout time with GLaDoS in potato
              form.
            </p>
            <p>
              The writing is fairly good, but the player really needs more
              downtime between barrages of jokes, and perhaps some more sinister
              elements of the plot. Many "escape sequences" you'll perform are
              not cutscenes but so rigid in execution that they may as well be.
              Additionally, finding the solution on the fly (and being punished
              when you do not) in these action sequences was really grating and
              sometimes patronizing. In many instances it felt like I was being
              shoved along to the next setpiece instead of just allowed to
              experience the game at my own pace. If <i>Portal</i> was a
              psychological thriller, <i>Portal 2</i> is like a generic 2010s
              dystopian action flick, with a lot of spectacle and big "moments"
              that fall flat in comparison to P1's quieter, darker reveals.

              On the other hand <i>Portal 2</i> is quite mechanically developed,
              with a number of welcome twists on the usual gameplay with light
              bridges, laser switches, super-speed and bounce paints, and these
              antigrav tube things. More of the puzzles here actually require
              some parsing and time to work out, especially in the third act.
              The co-op mode pushes these concepts to their limit, with some
              genuinely brilliant solutions. I will say though that a number of
              the puzzles follow the slightly tedious structure of working your
              way to the exit, just to push a button so a cube drops at the
              front and you can navigate back to the exit to open the door. It
              feels like solving the problem twice and it's not fun. Other
              times, especially in Act 3, you'll find yourself in areas that,
              with one misplace portal, take a fair amount of time to "reset"
              out of, which feels punishing in an obnoxious way. There's also
              one puzzle involving an un-portal-able room and a bunch of white
              paint that is so janky that I wonder why it was left in.
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>Portal 2</i> is still one of the better games available in the
              puzzle genre and the fact that there is a fun story and a gorgeous
              setting on top of it make it somewhat deserving of praise,
              especially considering the well-integrated gameplay twists.
              Unfortunately, its fatal flaw is an outright refusal to
              understand, explore, or develop its source material. The original
              <i>Portal</i> would have never taken off the way it did if it was
              built for the stand-up crowd.

              <i>dev. Thekla, Inc., dir. Jonathan Blow</i>
            </p>
            <p>
              The Witness is one of the most beautiful, detail-oriented,
              well-thought out experiences you'll find in the medium. It took me
              2 failed and 1 successful playthrough to realize this, though, so
              I don't blame you if it doesn't appear that way at first. It is a
              game built as part-playground, part-office, and part-classroom,
              with each aspect being integrated seamlessly. The basic loop of
              the game is that you'll encounter a group of line puzzles where
              you'll first be introduced the basics, then given freedom to play
              around with them, and finally tested on what you've learned.
              Simple enough, but the best and cruelest aspect of
              <i>The Witness</i> is that you will have to teach yourself
              everything there is to know about the game besides the basic
              controls.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's up to you to figure out what every single puzzle mechanic
              requires of you without a single verbal, written, or visual
              tutorial, just by playing puzzles of increasing difficulty. It's
              up to you to accumulate the skillset needed to complete the game
              based on your successes in simpler "intro" puzzles scattered
              across the island. It's up to <i>you</i> to put together the
              mechanical implication of the drawing at the top of the mountain,
              and to learn to apply it to other environments. This is one of the
              most empowering things I have ever felt in a video game,
              scratching the same itch that unguided physical exploration does,
              amplified 1000 times over. While I can see how people who may
              struggle to understand certain puzzle mechanics would end up
              getting frustrated at the game's lack of guidance, it's also an
              indictment of their own ability (or willingness) to parse the
              given information.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not only are you asked to teach yourself the rules of the puzzles
              before you, but you'll also be asked to figure out things very
              seldomly touched upon in puzzlers - where to find the puzzles,
              where to physically view the puzzle environment from to procure
              information that helps you find an answer, how to access the area
              that you need by completing other tasks around the immediate area
              first. Occasionally the solution is not even visible to the player
              from the zoomed-in panel view that the game automatically puts you
              into, requiring you to poke around and bring your findings back to
              the panel and execute from memory. It is not only a puzzler, but a
              meta-puzzler, and the rules of engagement for both are completely
              up to you.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the audio-visual front, The Witness is a gem. What the
              environment lacks in next-gen hyper-realistic weather effects, it
              makes up for with a highly impressionist, painterly quality to the
              palettes and composition of the textures and their environments.
              Because the game is based on perspective, the environment must be
              static, to prevent someone from "mistiming" an exploration and
              missing a puzzle solution. With that constraint in mind, the game
              is quite nice to look at. There's hardly ever any music, but the
              few times it does arrive it's momentous, because it's striking
              alongside the extremely detailed and moody sound design. Each
              environment sounds precisely how they look, and sometimes that
              materializes in SFX combinations that can feel welcoming,
              oppressive, or indifferent to your presence.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also like that each of the areas thematically match their twist
              on the puzzles. The jungle, famous in real life for being noisy
              and dense with life and movement, tests your ability to parse
              auditory information. The area where you puzzle on transparent
              panels so you can trace the background is a glass factory,
              presumably making said panels. The Greenhouse plays with the
              perspective of color palettes by way of combinations of colored
              lights in hydroponic gardening rooms. It's a small touch but it's
              all very grounded and thoughtful.

              I am compelled to defend the merits of <i>The Witness</i> because
              disappointed with how awful the discourse surrounding this game
              is. Instead of focusing on the details of the work itself, the
              online criticism revolves mostly around Jon Blow's character,
              financial reasons, and time spent, which are very strange
              meta-factors to care about for a video game. People think Jon is
              up his own ass with the game, but this isn't really given a basis
              besides the fact that it's an artsy game that actually tries to do
              something novel. It's also relatively slow-paced when it comes to
              the mechanical movement of the machinery on the island - the
              lasers are set up slowly, bridges are move slowly, ramps ascend
              slowly, elevators move slowly. This is seen as some kind of a
              taunt for more defensive gamers who view their time as precious.
            </p>
            <p>
              Without getting too much into it, I think it's a relatively stupid
              position to take that every single work of art in a medium must
              succumb to constant and never-ending increases in player
              efficiency, as if making an elevator 2 times faster will unlock
              your brain like the Limitless pill. This is NOT a game where going
              fast is the objective, the point is to actually think, and to take
              actual breaks from thinking to not overwhelm and confuse yourself
              - you know, like how real life and classical learning take place.
              Blow's emulation of hundreds of years of real educational theory
              is suddenly a pretentious annoyance the second it's applied to
              games, which are apparently supposed to pump a certain amount of
              testosterone into your bloodstream per second. The obsession with
              discrediting this game philosophically is a merely because trying
              to do so for its actual design would be an impossible exercise.
            </p>
            <p>
              I don't want to spoil any more of the one million tricks this game
              has up its sleeves, but I can't say much else than to just play
              the damn game. Yes, it costs a lot of money, yes it's got
              controversy surrounding it because of some peoples' distaste for
              the creator. Fuck the noise, just try it. It's currently peerless
              in what it aims to do.

              SpongeBob: Battle for Bikini Bottom (2003) - ★★½✩

            </p>
            <p>
              Battle for Bikini Bottom is one of the most shockingly competent
              video games of the 6th console generation, with most proclaiming
              it a gem in a sea of licensed shovelware. I'm not here to
              completely disagree, because I think it's got a lot going for it,
              but I think people overlook many problems with this game precisely
              because of that "shock."
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's get the obvious thing out of the way - it's a game about
              SpongeBob, the character probably most emblematic of the American
              millenial generation. The show is great, appealed to a wide
              audience, and was immediately recognizable due to its unique
              setting and memorable cast of characters. I think most fans of any
              given non-games character would agree that the ideal video game
              for them would be one that reflects what they're all about.
              Spider-Man is obviously going to be swinging around and kicking
              ass. Riddick should be sneaking around and infiltrating high-tech
              facilities. SpongeBob... what exactly does he <i>do</i>? He works,
              hangs out with his buddies, has the occasional manic episode, and
              sometimes gets into some predicament he's got to sort out, usually
              diplomatically.
            </p>
            <p>
              That doesn't easily translate to a video game, making basically
              any type of game an imperfect fit, but the choice of 3D platformer
              as the genre is a decent one for the Bob because of the inherent
              focus on the world around you. While it still allows the player to
              explore Bikini Bottom as SpongeBob, he isn't exactly known for
              nailing tricky jumps or for fighting robots, the two major
              gameplay areas here. Right off of the bat, there's a small lack of
              synergy that makes it feel more like the genre prescription was
              arbitrary, or for the sake of something non-artistic like sales.
              Oh well.
            </p>
            <p>
              So what does it accomplish in its reasonable mission? I think much
              more than most people would have expected. The collect-a-thon
              nature of the title allows for a large number of scenarios that
              occur in or are inspired by events in the show. The humor is
              exceptionally close to the show's, with about the same hit rate on
              verbal jokes - and a majority of the original voice cast reprise
              their roles. The soundtrack is very reminiscent of the show,
              making effective use of the same slide guitar, woodblock, ukelele,
              tambourine combination the show was famous for. The stages are all
              based on memorable locations from the show and faithfully
              represented, making them fun to traverse. If you get stuck on a
              given challenge, the game bookmarks the spot in the start menu,
              allowing you to move on to something else and fast travel back to
              it at any time. The bosses are intuitively designed and test your
              full arsenal of moves that you've earned up until that point.
              Finally, the difficulty is not nearly as low as other for-kids
              games of the era, meaning the game holds the same all-ages appeal
              that its franchise does. That's quite the list for a budget title.
            </p>
            <figure class="dotted-line-above">

              <figcaption>
                while it doesn't look amazing, some cool ideas keep it afloat
                visually.

            </figure>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, it's not all gold and glitter, even by 6th gen
              standards. The art direction, while distinct in its representation
              of the show, really needed some cel-shading to make the 3D models
              look less dull and misshapen. The audio mixing was consistently
              horrible, with a flood of loud noises when you enter an arbitrary
              radius of a waterfall or cannon. While most characters are voiced
              by their original actors, those that aren't are immediately
              noticeable, Mr. Krabs and Mermaid Man being distracting drops in
              quality. The level design in the later stages becomes very
              repetitive with few notable landmarks and re-pasted assets and
              textures (Kelp Forest, the Mermalair, and Rock Bottom especially).
              A few levels rely very heavily on Patrick's fruit-throwing
              ability, which is unwieldy and feels unreliable on repeated
              attempts. Most of the stages are completed in a straight line,
              putting a damper on any significant feeling of exploration or
              environmental mastery. 10 of the spatulas in the game require very
              blatant money grinding to pay off Mr. Krabs, something I very much
              doubt any sane person would ever want to do. The very final boss
              with Robo-Plankton is a bit of a letdown after a great fight with
              Robo-SpongeBob, and deflates an otherwise good ending sequence.
              That's a decent-sized list as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              I understand that a lot of the appeal with this title (and other
              3D action-adventure and platformer games) is the ability to become
              the character, and just kind of passively experience the
              environment behind the mask. <i>Super Mario Sunshine</i> and
              <i>Odyssey</i> capitalize on this completely, with dozens of
              little toys in every level for FLUDD and Cappy to just mess around
              with, respectively. While I certainly understand kids who want to
              pretend to be SpongeBob and hang out in his house or "walk to
              work" or act out some other imagined narrative, mechanically
              you're not actually doing anything. SpongeBob has no way of
              interacting with anything without talking in canned text boxes or
              smacking it. Because of the mechanical dissonance, I have to say
              this sort of sandbox immersion is personally lost on me for this
              title. I don't feel rewarded for being SpongeBob, I feel rewarded
              for jumping around on platforms and finding rewards, so that's
              what I do. The franchise has basically nothing to do with that.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, <i>Battle for Bikini Bottom</i> needed a little more time
              in the oven to iron out some fixable flaws and integrate its
              systems better with its franchise. However, this is probably an
              unreasonable request given its release as a budget title, and was
              likely never possible to begin with. For what it is, and the
              resources it was given to spur its growth, Heavy Iron did just
              about as well as they possibly could have - but that in and of
              itself doesn't make it a classic.

              I feel good that I finally sat down and played this game. I first
              got it in the Humble Indie Bundle 5 back in 2012, which included
              this game along with Psychonauts, Bastion, Lone Survivor, Braid,
              Amnesia: The Dark Descent, AND Super Meat Boy. It was nothing
              short of a phenomenon and I personally attribute it to unlocking
              my perception of how much more games could be than generic AAA
              affairs. That makes this blurb I'm writing something like 7 years
              in the making, which is a stupid amount of time to sit on a game
              that is 3 hours long.
            </p>
            <p>
              My first impressions are my only impressions as I beat the entire
              thing in a single sitting, to my own surprise. I have a lot of
              respect for what <i>LIMBO</i> trying to do but I can't help but
              feel like it didn't succeed. The big striking selling point is its
              dark, monochromatic color scheme and oppressive world, making it
              look lovely in stills and videos but when playing, your mind sort
              of filters out the art into the functional visuals of what is and
              is not a threat, usable object, and possible to do. The animations
              are also goofy, making it very difficult to see this as an actual
              horror experience or even tense, and in some ways I'd say the
              high-contrast art is also a utility by the devs to hide somewhat
              sloppy physics.

            <p>
              The other selling point is that the game is somewhat challenging
              and you will die often because of it. I disagree with this two
              times over, as not only was I only stuck on how to progress
              logically for a handful of times, but almost all of the deaths are
              from trial and error platforming sequences or escape-the-room
              "puzzles" that are more about memorization and execution than
              actually solving anything. Occasionally, in the latest stages,
              progressing feels a lot like work, as very little perceptive
              ability is needed to progress, only patience and consistency with
              your inputs. With a game that's already plateaued tonally, this
              frequent tedium adds up to an experience that is way less fun than
              it should be.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have a few other gripes, namely the horrifically bad arthouse
              ending, the all-too-sudden end to the spider saga that feels
              unsatisfying, and the overuse of the brainworm sequences which
              turn an already clunky platformer into one that's also an endless
              runner game. But in the interest of fairness, I am still happy
              this game exists. It's one of the few linear, non-segmented
              attempts at something akin to the "cinematic platformer" titles
              from the 90s, where jumps are weighty and supposed to be done with
              purpose to help you progress in puzzles. While it's incredibly
              simple and lacks variety, depth, content, and overall polish, it's
              cool that someone decided to emulate that era, at least,
              especially in a package that looks relatively unique. I certainly
              don't recommend this for most people, but for those who don't care
              if games aren't fun, this is a decent recommendation for its
              novelty alone.

            </p>
            <p>
              <i>Xenoblade Chronicles</i> is one of those paradoxical classics
              where critical reception is through the roof but I've never known
              anyone who's played the game in real life. I definitely can see
              why people adore this game, and why the movement to get it
              localized in America was so intense, but after spending 90 hours
              with it, I will say firsthand that I don't really get the
              "classic" talk so much. It has heaps of content, sure, but most of
              it strays in the no-man's land of mediocrity, with some notable
              exceptions in both directions. In all, it’s a fine but not great
              video game that is mostly comprised of filler, aspiring to be just
              too much like a single-player MMO that your time playing it can
              feel unproductive.
            </p>
            <p>
              To its credit, <i>Xenoblade</i> is nothing short of a complete
              technical marvel for the Wii, with lush, enormous environments and
              some of the longest draw distances in any game I have ever played.
              The levels you'll traverse all take place on the overgrown corpses
              of two gods who killed each other at the same time, Bionis and
              Mechonis, their blades creating bridges between the two bodies.
              The former's body spawned flourishing organic life while the
              latter churns out hyper-advanced autonomous machinery, with its
              interior looking like a demented Tick Tock Clock.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every area in the game has a stunning vista of the giants from a
              new perspective, giving cohesion to the world and making your
              journey feel like it's amounted to actual progress as you slowly
              scale the titans. You'll encounter lonely, blizzarding mountains,
              huge mechanical towers, a series of floating islands mapping a
              graph over a crystalline sea, a lush forest filled with life both
              friendly and not, and luminescent marshes lit by the exotic
              wildife that found their homes there. In all, the level
              presentation and layout is a treat, some of the best I've seen in
              any game, and the technical wizardry needed to achieve it must be
              commended.
            </p>
            <p>
              To boot, each region has distinct forms of intelligent life that
              fill out the JRPG tropes you might expect for the time - fragile
              winged mages, hardy but dumb human-types, and the tricky cute
              Moogle-y guys - with large numbers of each race in the hubworlds
              and towns. The Nopon Village in the forest stood out to me as a
              highlight - the building was the carved-out inside of a massive
              tree with 9 interconnected floors packed with <i>hundreds</i> of
              bustling little Nopon with quests, stories, and items for sal.
              There was even a pool on the roof. The scope of the world is
              staggering and you'll spend hours just walking around trying to
              visit each place and talk to each person. Most people who live in
              their villages have never left them, and the distance between each
              civilization is so vast that when you encounter other people on
              your travels, it feels welcoming.

              Exploring these areas is fun, too, thanks to some small but
              refreshing tweaks to the turn-based RPG formula. First, and most
              importantly, there are no random encounters to speak of, and
              because the size of the enemies can range from insects to
              behemoths, you'll be able to visually affirm dangerous threats
              from afar and make physical routes around them to avoid their
              attention. The game is not at all afraid to zone off areas with
              enemies that are way above your weight class, so you have to pick
              and choose your fights. While some parts of the stages bottleneck
              you into encounters, a majority of them are optional.

              <i>Xenoblade</i> also has a really great take on the regeneration
              of your party's "vitals" - your health regenerates quickly when
              you're not in combat, making each fight feel insular and dynamic,
              and a complete lack of consumable items throughout the entire game
              means zero item management as you trek across the landscape. Is
              this less interesting than carefully managing use of your valued
              potions? Maybe, but many avoid the most useful finite resources in
              any game just out of preservationist habit, so <i>Xenoblade</i>'s
              approach cuts out some non-decisions from the player in favor of a
              system that makes it very easy to go out and accomplish what you
              need to do without tedious prep time. Additionally, all character
              "arts" (which amont to abilities and magic) are tied to in-battle
              cooldowns that start pre-filled at the beginning of each
              encounter, so it feels like you're fighting every battle at full
              strength every time.
            </p>
            <p>
              What you actually do in these environments is unfortunately tied
              to the restrictive set of gameplay actions <i>Xenoblade</i> gets
              out of its systems. Something like 80% of the game's content or
              more is tied to side-quests that aren’t really optional if you
              want to stay on-level. They are designed to encourage you to
              explore the environments beyond the story-related waypoint on your
              map, but the actual quests variants are very limited. You can hunt
              down a bunch of a certain beast, hunt down a larger, particularly
              nasty beast, farm items that only certain enemies drop, farm items
              that are found as glowing little RNG-based collectibles, seek out
              a unique glowing collectible hidden somewhere around the area, or
              talk to other people to settle some kind of conflict. Outside of
              the big game quests and the hidden-item quests, the incredibly
              limited nature of what you'll be actively working toward at any
              given time gets old pretty fast, with those two exceptions
              permitted as they promote deep exploration of the environment and
              defogging the map.
            </p>
            <p>
              If something isn't tied to a quest, though, it's a fair question
              to ask what the point of it is, because there are hundred and
              hundreds of quests to do. For example, there are a couple secret
              environments that exist simply to be a cool view or the area; from
              a utilitarian standpoint, this might be filler stuff, but I think
              it's easier to argue those little glimpses of
              content-for-its-own-sake as more passionate game design than
              chopping up 10 wolves for 1000G. Also worth noting that NPCs have
              a day-night cycle of whether they are even spawned in the
              environment, and without waypoints back to the quest giver, it's a
              pain in the ass to find anyone, especially if you have trouble
              putting the name to the face. Thankfully, a majority of the quests
              autocomplete at their conclusion, giving you the rewards instantly
              without need to track down the client, which is at least an
              attempt at solving that issue even if it’s inconsistently applied.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are plenty of other design flaws that make normal
              progression feel like a grind. The combat system is fairly
              undynamic with very few ways to create interesting strategies
              outside of passive stuff like putting gems on armor and weapons,
              and individual characters don’t have lots of tactical options or
              playstyles. Said gems have to be individually crafted with gem
              parts in a stupidly long animation, something that probably adds
              up to hours of gametime. Towards the endgame, not being able to
              control the entire party or change their tendencies like in Dragon
              Age starts to feel grating as the CPU-controlled characters get
              steadily less useful.

              Worst of all is the woeful story, one that manifests as a
              ridiculous revenge quest for upwards of 35 hours and ends in an
              unsatisfying way: your beloved, thought to be killed, was
              kidnapped and brainwashed instead. This could have been remedied
              by simply having her kidnapped to start the game instead - this is
              a better motivation to fight the Mechon besides going full
              Anakin-on-the-sand-people, and the ambiguity of her safety would
              have made the reveal that she is alive more impactful and less
              groan-worthy. After those 35 hours, the plot turns to standard
              ‘save the world, unite the races’ schlock that the hero seems
              somewhat disinterested in. At no point do stakes feel like they’re
              being built, and the absurd power creep at the end of the game
              feels childish.

              <i>Xenoblade Chronicles</i> is a game does not feel good to play
              around the time you hit the Nopon village, at which point the
              sunken cost fallacy has already settled in and you will
              begrudgingly see the game through to its conclusion anyway. It is
              about 40 hours longer than it should have been, and many
              individual aspects of the game frustrate me, especially the
              script, but the foundation is here to make something very special
              and large in scope. The setting is magical and the presentation is
              nothing short of tremendous, and in fairness
              <i>Xenoblade</i> brings meaningful mechanical evolutions to
              dead-end systems that have lived on too long in the genre. There
              is something in here, I just hope the sequels have less mess to
              parse through.

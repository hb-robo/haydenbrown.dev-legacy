                indulgence in contrarianism had its fingerprints all over the

                dives into jazz and electronic music from my years playing music

              <i>Places and Spaces</i> is one of the purest exclamations of
              positivity I've found in music. Everything about it is built to
              put a smile on your face: airy strings, joyful horn playing from
              the man himself, beautifully emotive vocal performances, and
              exuberant lyrics that place an emphasis on love and relaxation.

            <h2 id="album-subtitle">Sade - Love Deluxe (1992) - ★★★½</h2>
            <img

              src="../../img/music/rym-archive-vol2/love-deluxe.png"

            />
            <p>
              The first time I heard this album, I was reading a review of it
              that called it timeless music. I couldn't really understand what
              it meant at the time, but revisits to <i>Love Deluxe</i> over the
              years have been so profound and relevant for me, even in 2018,
              that even I have started to understand what "timeless" meant for a
              piece of musical art. This album was recorded in 1992 but if it
              released in any of the years between then and now it would still
              have been bleeding edge compared to its peers in pop music.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sade has always had an effortless air about her. Her voice is
              strong and powerful, with a fantastic sultry tone, but she wields
              it like a samurai wields a blade: it's only as necessary. Her
              ability to capture the attention of the listener is in strong part
              because of this restraint, not in spite of it. Vocalists from now
              until the end of time could learn something from that.
            </p>
            <p>
              The real star of <i>Love Deluxe</i> is the outstanding production
              on every single track. It's ethereal, organic, and even in moments
              of tension or energy it feels delicate. I can't imagine a better
              complement to the unique musical instrument of Sade herself. The
              band took influences from the budding (and that's putting it
              lightly) trip-hop scene, hip-hop breakbeat culture, the 80s
              ambient emergence, and jazz fusion tones of choice from the
              infamous explosive jazz fusion. The basslines are fat as fuck, the
              synths are airy and beautiful, the percussion is steady, and
              everything surrounds a central idea of this transcendent UFO pop
              music. It is right in line with the space-age revival scene that
              Stereolab was a part of in the <i>late</i> 90s. Again, this thing
              was built in 1992.
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>Love Deluxe</i> is not only ahead of the stylistic curve of
              1992, but respectful of well over twenty years of musical
              developments prior, willing to take Sade's sound in completely
              uncharted territory, and still sounds fresh today. Sounds timeless
              to me.

              Miles Davis - In a Silent Way (1969) - ★★★★

            <p>
              I do not how a single person could see this album's roster and not
              immediately buy the record. Given the solo works of all of the
              guest contributors, I also would not blame anyone for expecting a
              well-orchestrated explosion of dismantled standards along the same
              lines as many early Davis fusion records - what we got is
              something else altogether.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a twinkling, abstract jam with the greatest trumpeter,
              drummer, jazz guitarist, and keyboardists (plural!) to ever live.
              The closest thing you get to standing out is the very seldom solos
              from Davis, Shorter and McLaughlin, which hang in the air more
              like a dancing fairy in Fantasia than a commanding, show-centering
              act. The rest of the project is built in the shadows, building...
              always building, even if it excludes you from the spotlight. The
              40-minute affair doesn't even get audibly loud until minute 31,
              after which it retreats into slumber in minute 32.
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>In a Silent Way</i> is an unstoked fire that catches an
              occasional breeze and flickers to life. The very notion that it
              aimed to be much more (and much less, quantitatively) than the sum
              of its parts is an executive decision that is close to
              once-in-a-lifetime. For that, we celebrate.

              I know people usually use the term "MBV worship" in the shoegaze
              scene to cause offense towards artists, but in this case I think
              it's both applicable and a worthy compliment.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wouldn't be surprised if the <i>Robot World</i> sessions were
              recorded in a grungey, candlelit basement next to a wall of guitar
              pedals and a depraved shrine to Belinda Butcher and Kevin Shields.
              This thing is filthy, thick, and droning, and its impression of
              its inspirations is admirable.

              The enigmatic Jay Electronica's mystic, atmospheric, and
              occasionally sinister 15-minute EP rattled me more than many
              hip-hop projects three times as long ever could. Lifting samples
              from the film of the same name, <i>Act 1</i> has zero tracks with
              percussion, and yet Elec's cadence proves they aren't necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
              Believe the hype: In under 8 minutes of actual musical content
              (disregarding the skit intro, which you shouldn't - it's
              unadulterated praise from Erykah Badu), this is one of the great
              lyrical performances of the 21st century.

              Absolutely gorgeous record, swathing harp playing by Alice
              Coltrane conjuring a firmly psychedelic, dissociative atmosphere.
              Pharoah Sanders provides some horn and he kills it, soaring
              through these landscapes with intent and poise.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is not only one of Alice Coltrane's most accessible albums
              but also a stark opposition to the difficult, noisy technicality
              of most of her works. It sometimes suffers from <i>Lanquidity</i>
              Syndrome where it plays it a bit too safe, holding back from
              creating a demanding work that is also a tone piece instead of
              just the latter, but I find it extremely hard to believe anyone
              would not enjoy this record.

            <p>
              I can’t believe how much I return to this project. Its appeal
              totally escaped me outside of the singles when it dropped and just
              over a year later I’m lamenting that <i>Die Lit</i> doesn’t
              recapture the essence of Carti’s debut. This thing is addictively
              weird.
            </p>
            <p>
              Just to get this out of the way - this is just as abstract as any
              hip hop record you might have heard. Carti is completely illegible
              on more than a couple occasions, instead directing focus to his
              pretty great cadence and delivery. I’m not even sure if the lyrics
              are genuine or just a vessel for the song as a whole. I know this
              sounds like too much praise for a popular trap record, but I
              really am starting to think of Carti as totally deconstructive of
              his peers.
            </p>
            <p>
              The star of <i>Playboi Carti</i> is the production, as everyone
              else has mentioned. It’s approaching ambient trap, with lush and
              spacy textures, lighter emphasis on traditional percussion, and
              synth packs that remind me of Bomberman and Mega Man games circa
              N64-era. It’s infectious, complex, and the comparisons to Clams
              Casino are apt. The beats are sleepwalk visions, which is so much
              more fitting to Carti’s lethargy than the increasingly heavier
              instrumentals becoming popular in this scene in 2018.

              This is going to be lost on most people who take music at face
              value - a technique I am certainly not condemning! - but Carti’s
              deconstruction and experimentation of 2017 trap tropes brings them
              closer to the essence of the genre’s appeal than more lyrical or
              energetic efforts. It’s kind of effortless, but he and Pierre put
              on a show, and it’s one of a kind.

              This dude is clearly a virtuous bass player, and has exceptionally
              good taste for improvisation, but I really can't say the same
              about his vocal performances or his songwriting in general. I'd
              rather just hear him play, and my favorites on the album reflect
              that.

              A lot of the tracks shoot themselves in the foot for no reason,
              like "Boat Cruise" that neuters a funky Rhodes jam with an awful
              panning synth pad that sounds like the worst of Chicago House. "Is
              It Love?" and "Walkin'" feature some truly awful vocal
              performances as well that really take away from how polished
              everything else feels.
            </p>
            <p>
              Still a promising debut with a couple jams, but it's clear that
              Thundercat's current problems - cutting through aesthetic filler
              to get the actual core of his songs - are ones he's always had.

              pop revivalism seems misinformed, missing the mystery, darkness
              and moments of quiet that made the movement so compelling, instead

              Pram’s outstanding debut forgoes technical mastery for a fragile
              beauty. Cuckston’s vocals are disharmonious, and the choice of
              instruments is makeshift. The end result is raw, sloppy, and a
              little frightening, but underneath is pure familial warmth, a
              homemade meal cobbled together from scraps.

              The brilliant "The Ray" fully realizes this, burying a toy synth
              and lullaby vocals beneath field recordings of a howling blizzard,
              evoking the image of something barely alive out in the cold death.
              There's something captivating about walking that line between
              comfortand discomfort, about making your home in a dangerous
              place, and Pram captures it perfectly.

              <i>Finally...</i> is the musical equivalent of tilt shifting.
              Every moving part feels tiny and delicate - mechanical clicking,
              organic bubbling, and glittering synths dot the canvas.
              Unfortunately, the compositions in the shorter tracks are so
              fragile that múm refuse to do much melodic work at all, they just
              set up the camera and let it run. All setting shots, no subject...
              even if the setting is compelling.

            <p>
              The longer tracks suffer from a separate issue: Icelandic artists
              in 2002 couldn’t outrun Sigur Ros’s shadow, and their post-rock
              crescendos creep into compositions where they aren’t welcome. Múm

            <p>
              Sweet Trip’s debut incorporates most cool musical ideas of the
              1990s - huge walls of sound, dreamy male-female vocal duets,
              guitars drowned in reverb, textural analog electronics,
              polyrhythmic IDM clicking and clacking, sweeping synth pads, and
              fat techno basslines - and pulls it together effortlessly, as
              though the ideas were never disparate to begin with. Even in its
              then-trendiness, it can be seen as something of a Rosetta Stone
              moment, translating the analog and digital music worlds for one
              another. It’s just got more sound than content.

              most tracks can be exhausting in their bliss, like being beaten
              with a pillow. <i>Lotusize</i> is forward-thinking without fully

              anything I feel like he didn't lean far enough into the pillow
              zone - songs like "The Injury" start like lullabies and become
              gradually less comforting as the track goes on and more variations
              on the theme occur. It's sort of a bummer and it helps explain why
              no tracks really take that leap into greatness. Kind of goes hand

              intervention - without these old-school titles getting the full
              AAA treatment, they will never sound like this. You might be able
              to get it to look and play like <i>R4</i>, but unless you've got
              an unlimited music budget you're not touching this. It's the one
              hurdle indie games have never been able to handle. Anything past
              chiptune or 5th-gen horror-synth is just too difficult to properly
              emulate for smaller teams. Unless these PS1 revival games start
              making a killing, in order to get your game to sound like this,
              you just had to be there.

              This phenomenon leaves <i>R4</i> in a cool place, where it's
              obviously super dated and glorious, revered by all fans old and
              new, and yet unable to be recreated. Although it and other
              knockout VGM soundtracks of the age (Ape Escape, Bomberman Hero,
              WipeOut, etc) tend to be a little... much for me, even my ear for
              the corny dance house vocals and disco strings and soaking wet
              Rhodes lines, it's still hard for me not to recommend this one.
              You might have to take it down in smaller doses, but it's such a
              rush.

              Aphex Twin - Richard D. James Album (1996) - ★★★½
            </h2>
            <img
              class="album-cover"
              src="../../img/music/rym-archive-vol2/richard-d-james.jpg"

            <p>
              A common perception of Aphex Twin and his early-90s Warp
              contemporaries was that of misanthropes, pushing boundaries in
              abrasive, inhuman musical spaces. Some artists, Aphex included,
              leaned into the fear and misunderstanding that their work conjured
              in listeners, but this branding also ultimately obscured the heart
              in the machine. <i>RDJA</i> is a shockingly sincere, introspective
              project, with no big scares befitting of the album cover.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even within Aphex’s typically frenetic language of expression, the
              bright synths, bitsy pitters and patters, and wonderfully tacky
              MIDI instruments are knitted together in a convincingly tender
              way. The result: a low-resolution, heavily artifacted
              self-portrait.

              Squarepusher - Feed Me Weird Things (1996) - ★★★☆
            </h2>
            <img
              class="album-cover"
              src="../../img/music/rym-archive-vol2/feed-me-weird-things.webp"

            />
            <p>
              Tom Jenkinson’s debut as Squarepusher is wonderfully weird - it’s
              playful, rambunctious, easily distracted. Crucially, it also
              boasts a great sense of self-deprecating humor, showcasing its own
              absurdity.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Smedley's Melody” is the best example possible: what starts as a
              kitschy little digital jam sesh gets hijacked by an spasmodic
              blitz of a breakbeat, kicking up the room and making everyone feel
              just a little uncomfortable. It sounds like a socially inept MPC
              trying to learn how to talk to the other instruments, and it's the
              perfect metaphor for how Squarepusher tries to reconcile his jazz
              upbringing with his rapid-fire beat obsession.
